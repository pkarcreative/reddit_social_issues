"Mortgage Repayment Calculator - Principle  Interest Daily

"Building and Pest reports before buying a house. SureReport
Hi all Im starting with an idea and Im endeavouring to assist property buyers across Australia save time and money with their due diligence journey. The business is called SureReport. Im here to ask this community for some feedback in relation to if my avenue of approach is right on or needs further tweaking. So, the spiel to explain the premise of my idea is, When buying a house for your due diligence, you commission a building and pest report which costs between 500-1000 in Australia per report, what happens to the report once it has been commissioned and read. What if you have to commission 2-3-4-5 reports it all adds up trying to find your dream home or investment property. 7000 later!!!! real world situation Atm. What if there was a company that allows for the commissioned reports to be consolidated, made available by the actual building inspectors via a central website? SureReport. SureReport is creating a marketplace for Building and pest inspection reports that are easily uploaded by the inspectors for resale and for purchase by members of the public at reduced prices. The reports are still current and valid. As part of a buyers due diligence checks before buying a house these reports will be made available at a reduced price because they have already been commissioned. Why would you re commission another report when there is one already done and available and its within the legally acceptable inspection time frames for a house inspection. If there are three reports on SureReport then you could potentially buy all three for the price of commissioning on at fully prices and conduct home buyer due diligence on steroids. nothing missed with three different inspectors. SureReport saving home buyers time and money by providing a marketplace for home buyer inspection reports. So, some of my questions would be to this community, 1.

"Rental Payments and Clearing of Funds
So the last two rental places Ive gone through have this weird policy about how its the tenants responsibility to ensure that their rent is fully paid up. I dont have an issue with that obviously, I just dont understand this little bit and Ive seen something like this twice now ... we strongly recommend allowing for a minimum of 3-4 business days on transfers for all EFT payments. It is your responsibility to ensure your rent is cleared in our trust account on time. Now hear me out. To be clear, I have no issue with paying the rent on time, but why is the tenant suddenly on the hook for the banks inability to process payments in a timely fashion? They rake in billions of profits every year and they cant even make payments faster for their business customers? Theoretically, if I get paid on a Wednesday, make my rent payment the same day, but it doesnt clear their bank account until 4 business days later i.e. the following Tuesday. How is this suddenly a me problem? Did all the computers suddenly unionise and decide they wouldnt work on weekends? Is it a quirk of the residential tenancies act that has created this situation or is this just regular old monkey tribe behaviour as in a bit of chest thumping, establishing hierarchical dominance, etc.",9,0.8,5,housing,Lease Renewal and Break Issues,Very Negative,1,2025-09-16 13:20:32,https://reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1ni6mhw/rental_payments_and_clearing_of_funds/,perth

Lenders are actually starting to offer products specifically designed for this, so its not as weird as it sounds.

We already have to look for pet friendly leases because of the dog, but I dont have the faintest clue what its like to try and add another pet once youve already moved into a pet friendly place. Reading the NSW gov page about housing it says that If a landlord has already consented to pets being in the property, then it is not necessary to reapply. This includes any pets that were approved before the new laws for keeping pets started. and Tenants who have already been given consent for a pet do not have to apply again. which implies to me that if theyve said yes to my dog, theyve by default said yes to a cat as well, but I would appreciate anyone who has any insight!",21,0.72,62,housing,Pet Approval and Rental Agreements,Negative,2,2025-09-16 08:52:57,https://reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/1ni0t85/how_difficult_is_it_to_add_another_pet_while/,sydney

Comparable sales ranging 1.05-1.15 in the last month or two, though would argue most of those at the upper end of the range have better fundamentals light, noise, floorplan Agent got back, said the vendor is looking at 1.1-1.2. Had a follow up after the second open house asking me if Id like to increase my offer to get ahead of others as the market is hot and there have been quite a few parties at the opens. I didnt budge and mentioned I would wait for other offers to come in, agent then commented he would be counting me out and wouldnt be calling back if he gets an offer in the range of 1.15, from another couple who are serious Im torn here and would really appreciate any advice. Should I wait this out and see whether the others make offers, hoping that the agent comes back to counter? Or increase now in the hope that it makes me more competitive acknowledging that no other offers have been made yet, and I dont know the position of the other couple - or would this simply be blindly negotiating against myself? If the property did go for 1.15 I think I would make peace and have considered that overpaying. However... lower than that and Id like to remain in the conversation as I do like the place Its all been pretty overwhelming, and Ive definitely felt the drain of the search for the past 5 months, so trying to stay realistic and level headed...

"My experience and comments on brokers. They can make you wealthy.
Just want to reinforce the point here to help out people who perhaps dont have large portfolios or experience. The amount of wealth you generate through property will be directly related to the quality of broker you use. I cant emphasize this enough. I have a large portfolio of properties and my income has never been particularly huge but I have spent a long long time with all sorts of financial maneuvers. All above board but you have to know how to work the system and work the rules. In my experience getting money comes down to from least to most. Least 1. Online lenders with cheap rates although the rates are good their serviceability is not any good but they are a good product for someone not trying to push boundaries 2 Banks - most of the time you were dealing with someone who has very little power but they still have the ability to influence to some degree. They might be able to get a little something waived 3. Brokers - brokers can massage an application And they should know which lenders are going to be more favorable considering your unique circumstances. But in my experience the difference between an average broker or even what people would consider a good broker even ones with fairly decent names and profiles out there comparing those to the top brokers is absolutely millions in differences in some circumstances. 4. Next level brokers who are probably only about 5 of brokers who have the leverage and direct connections with the lenders and who also do a lot of research on new products and new rules. This is where its really important is meeting directly with lenders all of the time and asking them what theyre looking at, what theyre looking for and understanding the rules and the hacks. The difference between a top broker and brokers that are considered good I have found to be absolutely immense. Even good brokers will deny that there is more out there when challenged because they just dont know how to get the money. And Im talking about ones with a good reputation and who are reasonably competent. This is where you need to keep searching and keep trying until you find the broker that can really take you to the next level and that can take a bit of searching and of course filling out paperwork and trying it all out. Many brokers make a lot of promises but dont actually have the connections and the knowledge. Most 5. Corrupt brokers. Ive never used one but I do know of them and I have been told about their different techniques. There are many ways essentially involving lies which is equal to fraud. Actually fairly common then you may realise particularly among certain communities. Theres a pretty clear tier list there based on backgroundcountry of origin but of course Im not going to talk about that here. But lets just say some of the world is pretty sophisticated in regards to this kind of thing. This falls into two categories one is the lenders dont really care that much from a risk point of view but they care about APRA so theres playing in the kind of dont ask dont tell space. And then theres those where the lender would reasonably care about being lied to because its outside of the risk space they want to play in. Dont ever be tempted do deal with any broker that tells any sort of lies because while some of the strategies appear to be low risk you would just totally screw yourself if you got caught. But its been eye opening to hear whats out there. The only other thing once youve got the best broker you can get is stock selection. Thats really important but its not that hard but its amazing how many people are making silly mistakes and getting sub optimal growth or no growth. I might make another post on that.",0,0.17,27,housing,Housing Market Challenges and Property Insights,Positive,4,2025-09-15 08:16:04,https://reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1nh4mbv/my_experience_and_comments_on_brokers_they_can/,ausfinance

So I find myself in the very fortunate position of being able to finally pay of the mortgage.

Ive been doing a lot of research about purchasing in trusts. From what I understand, if you buy a property that is positive geared through a trust, this will exclude the trust from your serviceability review and protect your personal borrowing capacity, therefore allowing you to create new trusts and purchase new ips. My question is, if the above is true and if the trust isnt positively geared but its cost is low, 10k per year, will all of the trusts debtobligations be part of the assessment criteria for future purchases or only the obligation of how much it has cost in recent years ie over its last 2 tax returns?",0,0.47,15,housing,Property Investment and Financial Planning Strategies,Negative,2,2025-09-14 15:37:40,https://reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1ngj0o1/buying_ips_in_trust/,ausfinance
"Buying in individual name or family trust?
Hey all, Im really conflicted about what to do and Id love to hear your opinions! Im 30 and my husband is 36. We currently have one positively geared investment property in our individual names with a 550k mortgage. Were about to buy our second investment property and are considering putting it in a family trust. The main reason is that once the property becomes self-sufficient, it could help free up our personal serviceabilityborrowing capacity if we want to buy another property in the future. The challenge is that the second property wont be positively geared right away. It might take around 510 years depending on interest rates and extra repayments before it turns profitable. We would be able to add about 10k per year and possibly a lump sum 30-50k to help it become positive faster. If it is sorted within 5 years, I could see us going for a third property. But if it takes closer to 10 years, my husband will be 46 by then, and Im not sure if thats pushing it too late for borrowing and quality of life? If we buy in a trust, it will cost us around 2,500 extra per year land tax, accounting, tax return. Thats money wed be paying just for the possibility of having more borrowing power in 510 years  which might only mean we end up with three properties in total. A few things Im trying to weigh up - Is it too optimistic to assume interest rates will come down within 5 years? - Would the trust actually make things easier in the long run, or is it not really worth it if were only likely to have 3 properties max? I feel like the serviceability benefit would be more for people who have 5 properties and buying more. - Since asset protection isnt a big deal for us and were not high-income earners so tax distribution isnt critical, does a trust still provide enough benefit compared to just buying in our names and focusing on paying the mortgages down? What do you think? Would it be smarter to keep it simple in our names, or is it worth setting up the trust now for the potential extra flexibility later?",0,0.29,11,housing,Property Investment and Financial Planning Strategies,Negative,2,2025-09-14 14:31:03,https://reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1nghvws/buying_in_individual_name_or_family_trust/,ausfinance

"Why dont property developers want to renovate McWhirters Marketplace in the Valley?
This is a sequel post. For a city thats hosting the Olympics in 7 years time, if Bris people find Uptown in the Bris CBD has gone to shit, with how fucked McWhirters Marketplace in the Valley currently is, its several times worse from the almost 1 year old article below thats on a Courier Mail paywall. - McWhirters Marketplace tenants fear for their safety as homeless and junkies roam ghost town. One of Brisbanes most iconic department stores today resembles a ghost town, with a shop owner saying the centre is overrun with homeless people and junkies. November 4, 2024. McWhirters Marketplace in the Valley was once Brisbanes most fashionable department store, but in present day, theres an eerie feeling about it and it resembles a ghost town, with stores shuttered up, sections in disrepair, junkies and homeless people roaming its corridors. MM was built in the early 1900s and for almost a century was considered one of Brisbanes largest and most sophisticated department stores, including decades trading as Myer. However, a walk-through by The Courier-Mail on Monday found more than a dozen shops shuttered and several For Lease signs. Inside the entrance to the grand old building on the corner of Brunswick and Wickham streets, I saw a homeless person sleeping rough on the ground near the iconic escalators that were cordoned off for repairs. The heritage-listed building has seen better days, with roof holes and wall graffiti, while there were more shops closed than open throughout the mall, with several including a butcher shop closing in recent weeks. The select few stores open on Monday included a newsagency, barber shop, discount variety store, food  veg store, nail  beauty parlour, jewellery store, Red Cross and some eateries within the food court. The owner of one of the few open shops told The Courier-Mail that the shopping centre complex had gone downhill since Covid. Its a shame, as its so close to the city and it should be busy. Theres so much potential, but youd need major renovation. While the building is in need of repair, the man questioned what improvements could be made. McWhirters is an old heritage-listed building, so it cant be demolished. How are you going to change it? Its not the building itself and people dont come because of the surroundings. He said the shopping centre had been impacted by the homelessness crisis and the presence of drugs in Fortitude Valley. Theres a lot of homeless people here and a lot of junkies, its not a good image at all. Its all fucked up and it doesnt feel safe to come to the Valley. Theres also other problems. Stealing is very common. Ive become a security guard. I protect myself every day when I come here. I dont feel fucking safe in this shithole and Im scared, because drugs are everywhere. Ive been in the building for coming on 6 years and its got significantly worse. The fucking place looks derelict. Why would you want to go there? I think for any developer coming on board, itd be a significant investment in renovating a building that has problems. The tenant took aim at the landlord for not stepping up to resolve what they could. I think the big issue is actually the fucking landlords who wont engage security to move on the homeless, drunks or fucking junkies  drug addicts, thats a big problem as well. The building has significant structural issues, like leaking pipes, the outside of the building, all the awnings have been hit and damaged by trucks and buses. We approached Bris City Council seeking no stop zones and things like that. The most theyve done is put up a sign. The tenant also raised concerns about the safety of customers and staff.

He called on the state government to step in to improve the condition of the building. I think there needs to be state government intervention, as without that, well go the same way as the now abandoned Waltons building. Theres a lot of problems. The surrounding area isnt really helpful for the business. Theres more homeless people around and the people coming here get in and just take drugs, they do whatever. The spokesman added its been difficult to attract new tenants to the building, with high operating costs also having an impact on the shopping centre complex. We have to really spend too much money to maintain the shop, so the people here as a tenant, if they pay the outgoing, theyd probably move out, because itd cost too much. The spokesman said numerous shops had closed in recent weeks. The butcher shop and sushi shop have left the centre. The small businesses cant really survive in such a shit place. When asked if McWhirters could ever be returned to its former glory, the spokesman had some reservations, I dont think so, as everything has changed, itd really hard to revive and go back to the old time.

"Unsure if I should purchase apartment or house
Gday everyone seeking some input from the hive on what approach I should take regarding my first property purchase. We have a deposit of 250k with approval for purchasing a property up to 1m. Realistically the propertys we would like to live in for the foreseeable future are around the 1.3m mark which makes this unattainable for another couple of years, we have the ability to save around 60k a year although are planning on having a child in the next year so this will be impacted eventually. Do we stretch ourselves and purchase the most expensive property with land that we can afford or opt for an apartment around the 750k mark to take advantage of first home owners grant and stamp duty concession? Roughly calculated that the schemes would have 30k impact on overall cost The goal would be to pay the apartment down as quick as possible and then use the equity to fund a purchase of a house within 5 years. Im concious of the housing market increasing during this time however the appeal of an apartment in a better area is appealing for the time being whilst not staying out of the property market completely..albeit less potential for capital growth. Is this a silly approach? Pros of apartment would be closer to parents who are aging as well as being close to my son which is a shared custody situation that makes for a minimum of 6 hours travel each week at present..buying a house in this area is just not possible. If anyone has used a similar approach or has feedback that would be much appreciated.

"Stamp duty concession
EDIT I called the QLD revenue office directly for this. If you buy a tenanted property as a first home buyer you can claim the full stamp duty concession up front with the contract of sale. If the tenancy ends longer than within 6 months of settlement you must fill out a form on the website within a certain notice period if you cant convince the tenants to move out within 6 months using financial incentives and you must pay back the full concession at this time with interest depending on the concession amount. However depending on the amount of stamp duty and the rent the rent may completely cover this stamp duty anyway by the time you have to pay it back. So essentially you would get a loan for the stamp duty concession from the QLD government and pay it back if you cannot fulful your obligations within 6 months of settlement. I could not find a clear answer to this on the QLD government websites, but if I buy a tenanted property and the tenants move out within 8 months not the required 6 after settlement if the tenant doesnt accept financial incentives to move out early which is their right if course, but I still move in immediately after the tenants move out so within the required 1 year post settlement, will I have to pay back the full stamp duty concession initially waived or just a portion of it since Im still moving in within the year of settlement?

Hi all, Looking for some outside opinions as were trying to future-plan our finances. Married, 32  31. 2 dependents under 4. Currently in a 1.6m townhouse with 160k mortgage. 600k sitting in offset. Single steady income of 200kyear. My wife runs a side business while on mat leave if she returns 2 days a week wed expect 80kyear. Were considering two paths Stay put townhouse is fine, very manageable mortgage, continue to build savings. Upgrade buy a property on a larger block in the same area and build a single dwelling mainly to future-proof for size as kids grow and also for long-term capital growth. Our concerns Kids will be starting school soon likely private, so expenses are about to ramp up. While the equity and growth case for upgrading makes sense, the timing may stretch us once school fees  lifestyle costs come into play. Would love to hear from others whove been in a similar position,do you think upgrading now is smart while interest rates are still manageable and were relatively young, or is it better to consolidate and keep the low mortgage until school costs stabilise? On a final note we have a 10 year housing plan to be living in a more affluent area where median housing is around 3.5mil. Is the single house the better choice for that capital growth to get us that one step closer? Edit - I have owned and operated multiple side businesses in the last 8 years and sold one for 6 figures which put us into a good position. I then built 2 townhouses and sold one off living in the other. This is what got us to where we are today.

"Urgent guidance needed Splitting loan after refinance for tax tracking investment loan  extra borrowings
Hi all, Im hoping to get some guidance around splitting a recently refinanced investment loan, especially in terms of tracking deductible vs. non-deductible interest for tax purposes.  Background  I refinanced my investment loan from WBC to Macquarie.  New loan amount 650,000  I borrowed a bit extra to invest in shares in the future.  Settlement details  WBC loan balance on settlement day 576,192.77  Macquarie settlement breakdown  WBC loan repaid 578,477.22  Landgate title registration WA 433.20  Macquarie documentation fee 350.00 already deducted from the loan amount  PEXA fee 70.18  Title searchreview WA 54.95  Balance of funds received 70,614.45  Questions  1. Loan Split  I requested Macquarie to split the loan as follows  578,477.22  Deductible used to repay original investment loan  71,172.78  Non-deductible extra funds to be used for future share investments  Combined, thats 649,650, which accounts for the 350 documentation fee Macquarie deducted upfront.  The WBC balance was 576,192.77, but payout was 578,477.22  I assume the difference is accrued interest and discharge fees?  2. Offset Account Strategy  Should I place the 70,614.45 balance of funds into the offset account against the 71,172.78 split non-deductible portion?  Can I top up the offset slightly e.g., add a bit of personal funds so that only 1 remains interest-bearing on the non-deductible loan, to improve tax efficiency?  3. Loan Fees  How to Apportion?  Although the total loan was 650k, the 350 documentation fee means only 649,650 was available.  That 350 cant be deducted from the smaller 71k portion, since I need the full amount for share investments.  The fee relates to the loan as a whole  so how should I apportion it for tax purposes? Can it just be absorbed into the deductible portion, even though its technically applicable to both?  4. Timing of the Split  Does it matter for tax deductibility if I formally split the loan a few days after settlement?  Or is it sufficient that the intent and usage of funds are clearly documented i.e., 578k repaid the investment loan, 71k was held for future investment? Any insight or examples  especially from people whove refinanced and borrowed extra  would be incredibly helpful.

Hi Everyone, Have been umming and ahhing on this one for a little bit, unsure whats the best financial decision.

Current investment loan is on IO given the PPR wasnt offset when we bought it. Im looking to refinance banks and am wondering if I should churn the investment loan over to a OO PI loan to get a better rate around 40 bps difference. Pro - lower rate, less interest paid. Con - impact on cashflow given loan amortisation. The other option is to keep things as is, and just put surplus funds into the current investment loan offset, but I think from a numbers perspective its better to put it on PI for the better rate even with the hit to cashflow? i.e on a 1m loan it would cost 9.6k in repayments pa but save 4k pa in interest.

"How do I legally create an additional bedroom or toiletbathroom in a strata apartment? Obtain strata committee approval and council DA approval? Anything else?
Location Sydney Am hoping to be able to create an additional bedroom in an apartment. I would do this by SIMPLE renovations such as installing doors - adding walls. For example, creating an additional bedroom from a sunroom, living room etc. I would NOT be knocking down walls or replacing walls with structural beams etc. I think I need to do this Apply to the strata committee for approval. Make a DA application to the council. I had a look on the council website and DA applications are long as they are for major renovations. You have to prove you are not uprooting trees, that you have proper waste management etc. Hope I can streamline the process. What if I want to create a toilet in the laundry, or turn the laundry room into a full bathroom? Is it the same process? After this, how do I legally have the floorplan changed to incorporate the additional bedroom or toilet or bathroom? So that when I sell or rent I can list it on websites such as REA or Domain as real bedrooms and toilets. I have seen lots of listings where the bedroom or toilet is drawn with a dotted line.

"Should I buy the house?
Currently placed a 500k offer for a property, which was the maximum I have been pre-approved for with 10 deposit. The agent has informed me that I am currently second in the running with the top offer sitting around 510k. My pre-approval was based on earnings last year which involved a large amount of overtime taking my gross income to 120k. This level of overtime is not guaranteed as was earned doing emergency response with state government and my base salary currently sits at 79k. After my pre-approval expires on 1st October, a renewal would be based on my current FY income which has been at base, and thus would drop my borrowing power significantly. Additionally, with more places in the 5 first homebuyer scheme coming at the start of October, I expect this will bring with it further unavailability and unaffordability of properties in my price range. A few things to note - I am a first homebuyer and still have a HECS debt. When the 20 forgiveness is applied my HECS should drop to about 2500, and then further reduce down to a few hundred come next FY, which I would then pay off. - My wage will increase to 83.2k on 1 May 2026, and pay increases are structured within the public service. There is also a fair amount of promotion opportunities I can seek. - I am currently in a lease share house, 220wk rent until end of January 2026. The vendor is seeking a 90-day settlement period which works well for me. - I have collected most of the appliances and furniture I will need when I move in fridge, couch, washing machine and drier, etc.. If I were to offer 515k for this property which I believe is still a fair offer for the home, I would end up with only a few thousand dollars leftover. I currently can save about 600week, so would accrue 7800 savings during the settlement period after closing costs etc. this would leave me with approximately 10k in the bank. I would need to pay out the final month of my current lease, but ideally we would receive back our bond payment that would cover this. After budgeting all prospective home  living expenses bills, groceries, spending money, etc., this would leave me with approximately 60mo leftover until the pay rise in May. Budget spending is based on my current spending allowances which I have been able to maintain comfortably. There is also the possibility that overtime opportunities will arise in that time. Am I an idiot to put in this type of offer that would leave me temporarily quite low on cash?

Is someone selling a tenanted property likely to accept a 90-day settlement period?

Do I put a 90-day settlement condition in my offer and risk the seller just ignoring the offer or if my offer is still good will they ask me for a reduced settlement period?

I have since moved and rented it out as I could not find work around that area, so I moved somewhere more suitable. It has been rented out for the past 5 years and next year in April will be 6 years. My Thoughts  If I rent it out for less than 6 years, I can still claim it as my PPOR for CGT  Whilst it is still being rented out and before the 6 years is up I can sell and will be exempt from CGT  If I move back in before the 6 years are up, I can reset the 6-year clock My Questions  Are there any risk or anything I should be aware of e.g. ATO audits, proving PPOR status, record-keeping?  Am I right about the 6 year rule and no CGT?

"buy an investment property?
Hi everyone, I am thinking of buying a investment property somewhere in Sydney as I do not know much about investing aside from this. I bought a home 3 years ago and have rented it out and it is neutrally geared. I spoke to my broker and I am able to buy up to 1.5mill and was wondering if its a good move. I feel bad buying something else due to the current housing market and how many people are priced out. with my current tenants I have rented it approx. 200 below market per week and I have not increased it in 3 years and dont plan to - as they are a young family and I dont like the idea of overcharging people trying to get by even though my real estate agent property manager seems to think im crazy . I know im not doing anyone any favours but I feel as long as it covers the mortgage I dont really feel the need to charge anyone anything extra.

"Shortage of Affordable Rentals??? What about incentives for landlords to offer below-market rent instead by reducing land tax
Ausfinanciers Like many of you, Ive been watching the housing situation in Melbourne and across Australia. The rental market is brutal right now, and it doesnt appear to be easing anytime soon. It feels like weve got a few problems all hitting at once  A general housing shortage  A shortage of cheap rentals for people on lower incomes  Families under financial stress, struggling to make ends meet Im a social worker, and I see people coming in again and again who need public housing or even just affordable rentals. The demand is massive, and the government simply cant keep up. The truth is that not everyone wants to live in public housing and thats fair enough. But its also true that not every landlord is a profit-driven developer squeezing every dollar. For example, I own an investment property outright. I deliberately keep the rent low, I try to be a decent landlord, and sometimes I even provide rent-free periods when tenants are in a tough spot. This isnt some humble brag or grandstanding. Im sure there are plenty of other mum and dad or nan and pop investors who worked their whole lives for their properties, and dont feel comfortable just selling them off to park the money elsewhere. Property has always had both a scarcity value and a psychological value people want to hold on to it for their families. So the idea that we can just force these people out of ownership through tax doesnt seem realistic and its part of why i feel were stuck. For context, I just got my land tax bill 5k, which is about a quarter of the yearly rent for this tenant. Add on rates and agency fees - it means it probably yields 2-3, maybe less. So yes, some would call it a bad investment. But Im not holding it purely for profit. If I sold it, the buyer would almost certainly double the rent, and that helps no one. So heres the idea instead of pushing landlords harder, what if we incentivised those willing to provide affordable rentals? TLDR Private landlords helping fill the gap that government just cant keep up with. Maybe its as simple as easing up on rates and land tax for those charging, say, 2030 below market. I know local and state governments would never love that its their revenue stream, but something has to give. Of course, it would need proper oversight, reporting to SRO, verification, etc., but at least it would appeal to those who CAN afford to help and are willing to make that commitment. Feels like this could boost the supply of affordable rentals a lot quicker than waiting for the government to build. Or we just keep relying on the supply-and-demandprofit model and hope it somehow works for everyone.

Well also be on higher salary, by at least 10k, maybe more  early 40s, two kids, so not super keen on living in a place we dont like for ten years to build equity, etc. Should we try very hard to find something under 850k and utilize the scheme, even if were sacrificing virtually all--or most of all--of the things we like about our current life location, property itself, etc.? Or should we wait a year and go for something that well definitely like better, but not use the scheme, and then be paying a higher mortgage assuming rates are similar, or slightly less than today? Anyone here regret getting in ASAP, only to wish theyd waited to afford somewhere theyd prefer to live?

"2 bedroom vs 3 bedroom townhouse
Looking to buy in Melb in a decent area. Partner and I dont have kids but want to have 1-2 very soon. Combined income around 235k, 45k savings, partner just started new job, Ive been in mine just over a year. Looking at using gov first home buyer scheme with 5 deposit, no LMI, same interest rate as if it was 20 deposit. Townhouses are currently more appealing to live in for us compared to the similarly priced older houses, despite the bigger land size of the houses. However we are still inspecting houses as a few of them we have liked, though a lot more people turn up to inspections for houses, understandably, so more competition. If we just look at townhouses though, Ive noticed 3 bedroom houses are roughly around 100k more than 2 bedroom if the property is similar. Our budget really should be around say 825k absolute max, but ideally less. We would like to go 3 bedroom as a preference, with kids in mind and just to have more space, potentially help resale in future as these are generally more desirable. However, with 2 bedroom, thered be less stress, more options in places for sale, and we could probably get into the market a bit sooner. The other option might be say converting the garage to a third bedroom, or getting a place that has enough space for another room extension, but this would potentially require the sale to include owning the land which allows any modification, pending council approval. Also a lot of money. Could upsize later, but with say 45k stamp duty, the property price would have to go up a fair bit and not ideal to move in somewhere while already having plans to upsize soonish I was thinking. What would you do in this situation? Worth the extra stress and money for 3 bedroom with more long-term livability? Or get in with 2 bedroom for cheaper, and look to either sell to upsize later, or make updates to the property? Thanks.

This article nails it. Its about bloody time someone articulated exactly whats happening in the property market. The rising costs  stamp duty, levies, strata fees  combined with the absolute certainty of looming tax changes its a perfect storm of investor panic. People are smart, and theyre reacting to the reality theyre being bled dry. Vidlers point about investors pulling out and owner-occupiers snapping up those properties is dead accurate. Its basic supply and demand, isnt it? When incentives disappear and costs explode, investors flee. And those owner-occupiers? Theyre not buying because they want to, theyre buying because theyre seeing a genuine opportunity. Ive been saying this for months! Why are so many investors still stubbornly clinging to strategies that are demonstrably failing? Its like watching a train wreck in slow motion. Lets talk about the fear factor too.

"help Bought land in Wollert Rise, now facing unexpected double-storey restriction  need advice
Hi everyone, My name is Elias, and Im the owner of Lot 106 in the Wollert Rise development. Im currently facing a challenge related to the updated design guidelines issued in February 2025, which require a double-storey home on my lot. I didnt purchase the land directly from the developer, but through a real estate office. The previous owner was an investor who had originally planned to build a single-storey home. After being denied approval by the developers, he sold the landand deliberately included an outdated version of the design guidelines that made no mention of any double-storey requirement I found out about this only recently. I was never informed of the updated rules, and nothing in the contract of sale indicated such restrictions. My wife has a health condition that makes a single-storey home essential for our daily living. Ive submitted a formal request to the developers for an exemption, but havent received a response yet. We currently live in a rental property, and have received notice that our lease will end in December, which adds urgency to our situation. Im reaching out to ask - Has anyone here faced a similar issue? - Has anyone successfully received an exemption from the double-storey requirement? - Are there any steps or contacts youd recommend? Any advice or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.

"FHSS Strategy
Not sure if this reasoning is correct so I would like to get some feedback on it. Suppose an individual has a yearly income of 95k and has 100k savings, while actively looking to purchase their first home in the next 6 months. If they have enough rolled over concessional contributions cap, they could contribute 50k towards FHSS concessional contributions which allow them to claim a 50k deduction in the current financial year. On top of this, they can then apply for a withdrawal under FHSS in the next 6 months when they sign for a property purchase, for which they will receive 42.5K after 15 concessional tax rate  any earnings for the few months that amount sat in their super account. Of course this withdrawal will be taxed at their marginal rate, minus a 30 FHSS tax offset in this case 9. So while they most likely wont have 50K to use as a deposit, at the end of that financial year they will get a nice chunk back from the ATO. Is this correct? Am I missing something? Have I interpreted something incorrectly? Seems like a really good deal for someone who fits the bill. EDIT Perhaps something I have overlooked is what happens if their are no gains, but losses, in that time from when the contributions are made to the time the FHSS withdrawal is approved?

First I want to say I do have an appointment with a broker later this week and will ask them these questions, but I also want an idea before I go see them.

Theres a bit of background with I have a simple 2 bedroom 2.5 bathroom house, mum is ready to downsize and has offered to buy my house and then leave it to me in the will if I wanted to upgrade. So! I am trying to understand logistically how this works. Im getting a few valuations done this week expecting based off houses of similar size that have sold or on market a valuation between 550-600 but am also ok and aware that it may come in lower. I have 295k owing on the mortgage so even if it comes in at 500k I have 200k equity. Now I know the bank wont give the full amount and will give up to 80 of that value so 160k ish. Now here is where Im confused and unsure if possible to upgrade. I have 100k in cash, which is obviously not enough for a deposit but can cover stamp duty and fees. Is it possible to use the equity to pay the deposit and when the house sells pay the remainder of my mortgage off and put the rest towards the new mortgage.

Hi!

TIA  Cons to buying now - Vic state govt on track to build 200k new houses as part of new housing scheme  high supply in oncoming years - Less profitable as an investment property due to most expensive stamp duty  land tax  5000 annual Covid levy until 2033  negative annual growth -15 in Armadale, Vic in last year and harder market to sell back into Perth  Brisbane better for an IP Pros to buying now - Before lots of first home buyers enter market on 1 Oct due to 5 govt deposit scheme  increased demand for less expensive unitstownhouses - Investors selling up units  less supply of rentals and lower vacancy rate  more expensive and harder to find a rental soon Compromises - Buy a less expensive unit here 500k max to minimise the capital losses, invest the difference in shares",3,0.62,20,housing,Property Buying and Financial Decisions,Negative,2,2025-09-07 20:36:24,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1napwpe/proscons_list_of_buying_a_vic_ppor_in_the_current/,AusProperty

Myself and partner are wanting to move from country Vic back to my home state of SA in the next 12 months.

Mortgage is around 360k. Im not sure the best way to go about it, as we would be having to take on a much bigger mortgage in Adelaide due to housing prices. Im not worried about that, we are on a combined income of around 180k so we can afford a bit more. What I am worried about is we dont have enough equity at this point to cover a 20 deposit on a house in Adelaide, plus stamp duty and fees. We also dont want to exit the market entirely to move, as we worked so hard to get into the market in the first place. We also have about 20k in savings and a vehicle owned outright worth about 30k that we have been considering selling. Work is not an issue as we are both in fields that can find work quickly.

Hi everyone, First-home buyer in Adelaide here. I am preparing to make an offer to a property I inspected yesterday. I noticed that there were some cracks on the finishing baord, which I thought was quite normal for property of that age. I thought so long as theres no major structural issue found, its all cosmetic issues. However, when I was reviewing the draft contract, the contract had a building inspection clause which states The report will be deemed satisfactory if costs to repair do not exceed 10,000. The quote to repair must be provided by two independent contractors and be made available to the Vendor no later than the inspection date otherwise this condition will be waived. I suppose the vendor wanted to have this clause included because they worried some people might use those cracks as an excuse to pull off The unit was in its original 70s shape pepole who thought they could handle the reno could indeed change their mind afterwards. My question is, would that clause affects me if the building report I got during the cooling off period makes me feel like to pull off. Say, the estimate cost of repair is 9900 aud. Also, I wonder if it is appropriate for me to use the building report to negotiate with the vendor about the selling price of the property?

"Wardrobe Sliding Door Could Fall and Shatter  Who Covers Repairs?
Hi all, Weve been expecting a rent increase minor, but the place is already overpriced and requested some repairs, mainly our built-in wardrobe. This apartment has only had two sets of tenants. The first couple stayed 7 years, were coming up on 6, and weve had 4 property managers. The wardrobe was cheaply fixed, possibly by the previous tenants, the same tenants who used the dishwasher as toiletry storage, causing products such as shampoo to leak and ruin the internals, which had to be replaced. They also had to redo their exit clean because the first was subpar, according to the property manager at the time. The wardrobe has worsened over time. One sliding door constantly comes off the track, so we avoid using it because it could fall and shatter glass on us in bed. A handyman inspected it but said the job was too big and unsafe for one person. The PM emailed me after our call. For two minor issues he wrote, The quote has been sent to the landlord for review and approval. But for the wardrobe he wrote, Company to contact you directly to provide a quote for the wardrobe repairs. That wording makes me wonder if they expect us to pay since the company is contacting us directly. This has been a problem since we moved in, was not caused by us, and is a potential safety risk. Where do we stand? We love this place and its our home now. We dont want to rock the boat, but if the rent increases, we want these issues fixed for the money we are paying. The landlords are extremely lovely and we are very lucky to have them. This is a total investment for them they bought off-plan and have been involved since it was built. During Covid, they dropped our rent and did not ask for it to be made up once life returned to normal, saying we just want to make sure you are safe. They clearly want to keep us as tenants, as they did the previous ones. We keep the place in good condition and they prefer stable tenants rather than new ones every year.

"Typical fence dispute - advice
Hi everyone, Im hoping for some advice about a fence issue with my neighbours. Theyve recently emailed me through their real estate- its a rental property saying the back fence needs replacing, see pic. The real estate already contacted me about the fence a few weeks ago, and I replied then explaining that I cant afford it. Now, only a short time later, Ive been emailed about it again. Theyve also attached a single quote for the work  its over 4,000. If it ever really did need replacing, my husband could do it himself much cheaper as we have done in the past with a different neighbour and a damaged fence. From my perspective, the current fence isnt in bad enough condition to replace immediately  its standing, it provides privacy, and I dont think its unsafe. On top of that, were a newly single-income family with a brand new baby and can barely afford our mortgage each week, so paying thousands for a fence just isnt possible right now which I explained to them already. The tenants have a German Shepherd that digs at the fence. I cant help but wonder if the dogs behaviour is part of the reason the fence is loosening up and maybe why they want it replaced ir the owner wants a new fence to sell up. How long is the process of going through qcat and how much will them taking me to qcat will cost me?apart from half a fence? Has anyone dealt with this before? Anyone been taken to qcat? What actually happens if I genuinely cant afford it, and how do you even argue that a fence is still sufficient?

Looking for opinions on if we are doing the right thing. We want to move about 40mins away from home to a more ruralish area to take the pressure off. Background We are a family of 4, my husband makes about 127kyear and I make about 28kyear. I work part time nights and weekends mostly so that I can home with my smallest child who starts school next year. We pay our bills but its tight- just the basics. We have one car, no subscriptions, no extra curricular activities, no private health, home haircuts etc. We have managed to save a small amount over the year but weve just used that to pay off a Centrelink debt we had. The one thing we splurge on is private school and our child sponsorships which we dont want to drop because we feel strongly we want to give back and have our kids have a good education and theres not a lot of good public options here. Our house has been appraised at around 900K, we are looking at houses around the 600-650k mark although weve been looking at one that is perfect for us that would probably go for 660670. Weve got pre-approval for an offer subject to sale of our house. If this all went ahead we would have approx 160k left on the mortgage after stamp duty etc which would make it easier to pay down the mortgage, less interest paid etc. Ive applied for a job in the area we are looking at moving that pays around 45K with better super and salary packaging plus its early morning hours so I can be home by 10am and have 4 hours for working on a creative side hustle my dream. My husbands work has approved him to go fully remote hes already mostly remote. A similar school is half the fees. Insurance etc would be less. The downside would be we would be 40-60min drive from our immediate family we have cousins etc in new location. We are just trying to hustle, take the pressure off a bit and allow some budget for after school activities and getting a second car.

"Co-inherited property  funds need to setup an account to handle estate expenses
Key points So our parent passed away due to cancer but they bought a 300K townhouse in a complex before they passed, and set aside 50K to handle body corporate, council rates, etc, at least for a time they come to 10K per year. Im the eldest of 3 brothers - the younger two are in their early-mid 20s and arent great at holding down jobs the townhouse is partially intended to be a safety net for one or both of them and its being put under all 3 of our names. Youngest will be staying in the house, middle is in the same town, Im 1000km away. The current plan is the youngest whos currently actually staying there pays 100wk, the other two of us each pay 50wk the split is still up for debate, but thats what weve agreed to for now. Things like electricity, internet, etc will be paid fully by whoever stays at the house. I and other family members dont trust the two younger brothers to dip into the 50K for the house for party funds, etc, so were looking at either having myself be in charge of the account, andor do a joint account. Ive told them that if we as a group arent able to keep up with payments resulting in funds dwindling andor an unfair burden being placed on one or two of us that we should turn it into a rental or sell it and financially go our separate ways though Id rather avoid that in case they blow their money away. Whether they agree to either of those is another thing, but they are at least aware that the house can eventually be seized if bills arent paid. My questions 1. Perhaps this is more of an rAusLegal question, but is there any good reason to go with a joint account? My reluctance is just having to nudge them repeatedly to sign any eg fixed term account renewal paperwork, etc. My guess is a joint account would help reduce confusion come tax-time - ie it wouldnt appear as a source of income for myself. 2. Its been suggested to us that we setup a fixed-term account to maximise interest, with a secondary account that does the bill-paying - ie we start out by putting 40K into a 12-month or something, the other 10K goes into some flexible savings account and we both pay the bills from that flexible account and make payments into it. After 12 months we renew the fixed term, either keeping the same 40K if contributions have been sufficient, or less if the buffer needs to be used. Ive got a very busy job so Id prefer to keep things relatively simple, but is there a better way to do things here? 3. Looking at fixed-term rates, it looks like out of the bigger banks, ING seems to offer the best at 4 some like Judo Bank offer slightly higher but Ive never heard of them before.

Option A Max the Offset. Pause all share investing. Pour the 6kmonth into the offset. Become completely debt-free in roughly 2.5 years. Take the guaranteed win. Aware of potential rate cuts, but the guaranteed return is still strong. 2. Option B Stay the Course. Resume my simple DCA strategy 3kmonth into ETFs, the remaining 3k into the offset. Bet on long-term market returns outperforming the saved interest. 3. Option C A Different Split. e.g., 2k to ETFs  4k to offset, or another combination. A middle-ground approach. 4. Option D Leverage  Invest. Re-draw from the offset to invest elsewhere, like an investment property in QLD. This leverages the debt for potential growth but introduces significant risk and complexity. As someone who prefers a simple, hands-off approach, whats the smartest path forward? Keen to hear your rationale.

"The housing affordability crisis will keep eating the economy until we fix this one thing
It was on the second morning of the Financial Review property summit in Sydney on Tuesday that a curious story came across the wires US President Donald Trump was considering declaring a national housing emergency in the US, and making housing affordability his top priority leading into next years midterm elections. While the Trump story provided a reminder that housing affordability has become a global issue, on stage at the seventh annual property summit, it was clear Australias political class is well past the point of sounding the alarm. Were already living with a housing emergency that seems to permeate every corner of the economy. Productivity. Immigration. Business investment. Tax reform. When National Australia Bank chief executive Andrew Irvine listed the three challenges to Australias economic complacency this week, property topped the list. When AustralianSuper CEO Paul Schroder addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday, he said fixing the property crisis was the only real way to tackle the rising problem of intergenerational inequality. If you cant safely, securely house yourself, then we really are, I think, bent and broken as a country. While the property summit again raised doubts about whether the federal governments aspirational target to build 1.2 million homes over the next five years is actually achievable, there was a surprising level of support for the urgency Labor has brought to the issue under Housing Minister Clare ONeil. I think Clare ONeil is one of the most activist ministers in a generation, and certainly, weve never had this level of federal interest in getting the housing supply equation right, said Mike Zorbas, chief executive of the Property Council of Australia, who has been deeply critical of the way governments have approached housing matters in the past. Housing Minister Clare ONeil at the Financial Reviews Property Summit. Oscar Colman The 1.2 million home target, Zorbas argued, at least means we are no longer a nation with no plan, no agreement, no license for state planning ministers to walk into their cabinets and say, Im going to pick a fight with NIMBYs. That was evident from the very first speaker at the conference, when NSW planning minister Paul Scully accused anti-development residents in wealthy suburbs of trying to drown out the voices of future generations. They are almost actively vying to become the first suburbs without children and grandchildren as a result of exclusion by expense. As Zorba says, the case for a little housing supply optimism is building. Weve got a target that can galvanise different levels of government, as aspirational as it might be. Weve got the right things being said about planning and approvals. Weve got agreement on at least leaving the National Construction Code alone for a while. Weve got movement on national recognition of skills. Housing is the problem. So, whats the solution? But ANZ chief economist Richard Yetsenga threw down a contrarian challenge to the summit what if all these measures actually start to work, and the obstacles to a building boom fall away? Even if that was to happen, Yetsenga says, Australia would still be hit by the issue plaguing so many parts of the economy a lack of skilled labour. Who is going to do the work? Were 17,000 electricians short for climate-related construction alone. Apparently, we cant meet defence force recruitment targets. Most industries you speak to, certainly in this kind of material space, say we have a shortage of labour. Thats costing time and money. Veteran home builder Nigel Satterley, who is based in Perth but also has operations in Melbourne and Queensland, shocked the summit when he explained that in a team of four bricklayers, plumbers or electricians, the leader can expect to earn 500,000 a year, with the three other workers on 250,000. Master Builders Australia CEO Denita Wawn said completion times for detached houses have blown out from between six months and nine months to between 12 months and 15 months, while high-rise apartments now take four years, up from three. We all know what the skill shortages are. We need more workers.  Nigel Satterley, veteran home builder While improving education and training outcomes and getting more women into skilled trades can help, the challenge is that the housing sector is competing for labour against the infrastructure, energy and mining sectors. Immigration would seem to be the obvious solution, but in a week that started with divisive and occasionally violent anti-immigration protests around the country, thats vexed. The property industry always supports migration  more migrants equals more potential customers. Satterley said that since 2010, Australia has grown by a minimum of 1.1 million people and a maximum of 1.4 million people every three years. In his view, the country can easily handle migration of 1.2 million every three years. But weve got to get the right people, Satterley said. We all know what the skill shortages are. We need more workers. NABs Andrew Irvine says that of the 700,000 people who arrived in Australia in 2024, just 5000 had construction skills. While Clare ONeil told the property summit the number was more like 10,000, Irvine says it should have been 200,000. What are we doing? Of course, simply bringing skilled labour in isnt necessarily the end of the matter recognition of overseas skills remains a problem, with skilled migrants often required to retrain for up to 18 months before they can actually be thrown at the construction crisis. Theres a myriad of other problems at play here, of course. Irvine says were not using enough new technology, such as modular building practices, and questions whether enough medium density housing is built. Ross Du Vernet, chief executive of ASX-listed property giant Dexus, says construction productivity has gone into reverse in the past 30 years and remains a pressing problem in Queensland, where he claims productivity on union-controlled sites can be as low as 2.5 days a week construction unions have also tended to oppose big increases in skilled immigration. New forms of residential building models are emerging through whats now called the living sector, including land-lease retirement communities, where modular housing is providing a cheaper way for older Australians to downsize. And Domains head of economics and research Nicola Powell, also told the summit were on the cusp of a major demographic shift in the property market, as governments use the transfer of housing stock from baby boomers to increase densification across middle suburbia. The 2030s are going to be wild for our housing market, Powell said. The bones of a plan to fix the housing crisis are there increase supply by taking on the NIMBYs, improving planning and approvals, deploying better technology, rethinking the types of housing we are building and riding the tailwind provided by demographic shifts. But none of that works unless we have the skills to actually get houses out of the ground.",70,0.91,98,housing,Housing Crisis and Solutions in Australia,Very Negative,1,2025-09-05 11:11:47,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1n8rux8/the_housing_affordability_crisis_will_keep_eating/,AustralianPolitics

Ive had chronic health issues for years, so ease of accessibility to public transport and work is a main reason Ive gone with a city apartment. Now the building and pest came back with a major defect.

On the smaller side at 54 sqaure meters. 2nd bedroom would be my office. What initially stated with the agent agreeing to do the below, has now changed to a full renovation recommendation by both the Building and Pest inspector, as well as the inital plumber they got in to look at the works, due to the moisture damage. Of course, thats likely up to 25,000 correction. Initial planned works Quoted at 10,400 1 Bathroom waterproofing  consequential damage  Remove and replace grout to the shower recess  Apply three coats of a compliant waterproofing membrane and  Re-tile and re-grout the shower recess to prevent ongoing ingress. The attending plumber has advised that the entire shower recess will need to be stripped back and remodelled with new waterproofing, tiling, and grouting. Ive attached the report, as while Im happy to proceed with this purchase, these works are really very daunting for me. There is also still confirmation needed if I can do any further damage by moving in and using as normal for a few months. This has all been such a giant, anxiety inducing process but would love any tips or suggestions at this stage. I will state, its past the stage I can withdraw due to the major defect, Ive committed to process. Ive always been super risk-adverse in my life, and its gotten me nowhere.

"Buy a house or start a business
Hi all, I find myself in a tricky position deciding whether to buy my first property under 750k or start my own business. Im 36, single, with no kids, and a hard worker. I work in healthcare, so Im confident the business would generate steady revenue, but Im unsure which path to take first given the ongoing housing market growth. Based on my estimates, the business could generate an EBITDA of around 100k in the first year, 150k in the second, and about 300k by the third. Of course, these are projections, not guarantees. The alternative is to buy a house for around 750k and continue working for someone else. Ideally, Id purchase in a more affordable area and rent closer to the CBD for lifestyle reasons. I dont have renovation skills or the time to take on DIY projects. I am already in a business leadershipmanagement position so understand the necessities to get the business to run successfully and have a solid business plan.

You CAN find IPs in Sydney, but they are small studios. It is very hard to get a loan for a property smaller than 47 sqm. I have expanded my search to all around Australia. I would prefer a large metropolitan city, as I am afraid an IP in a regional or rural area will be hard to rentsell. Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Gold Coast etc would be great.

How about overseas then? I gotta try if I wanna get something. Edit 2 Thank you everyone for your advice. Well, looks like residential property in Australia may be out of my reach. Maybe I will look into purchasing a LUG maybe. Maybe even buying property overseas. I gotta learn and I gotta start somewhere. I had a look on REA.com.au. Studios and 1Bs are minimum 500k. And 30 sqm - which I cannot get a loan for. Even if I could, I would be wary as I am sure they would be difficult to sell.

"5 deposit 95 winge
The 5 deposit scheme often gets blamed for propping up the housing bubble but thats not what its doing. This scheme isnt aimed at investors or wealthy people with family money. Its for high-income earners who have little to no assets. People who might come from poor backgrounds, worked hard to get into medicine, teaching, law, or other demanding careers, and are now finally earning well. The chalenge for them isnt income its the deposit. Saving 20 while renting can take a decade or more. The 5 scheme gives them a chance to buy sooner, without needing help from parents. Often, these buyers arent just purchasing existing stock. Many will build new houses. That means more homes in the community, more construction jobs, and a boost to the local economy. Its not about inflating prices. Its about giving Australians without generational wealth a fair shot at owning a home helping grow the communities they live -- The 5 deposit scheme doesnt remove lending rules. Banks still apply serviceability tests, credit checks, and responsible lending laws. That means applicants must prove they can comfortably repay the loan on their current income, even if interest rates rise. Because of these safeguards, the scheme doesnt flood the market with risky borrowers. It only helps people who already qualify for a mortgage but are held back by the deposit barrier. The number of eligible buyers is limited, and their purchasing power is already capped by lending requirements. This is why the scheme wont substantially drive up prices, it simply allows qualified people without family wealth to enter the market sooner, without changing the overall lending standards that keep borrowing in check.",315,0.69,317,housing,First Home Buyer Deposit Scheme Discussion,Negative,2,2025-09-03 23:34:03,https://reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1n7eymf/5_deposit_95_winge/,ausfinance

"Anyone here actually planning to use the 5 deposit scheme for first-home buyers?
Anyone here actually planning to use the 5 deposit scheme for first-home buyers? The Home Guarantee Scheme federal, with some NSW support now lets eligible first-home buyers get into the market with as little as a 5 deposit and avoid paying LMI. On paper it sounds like a big win, but I keep going back and forth on whether its really helping buyers or just adding more competition and driving prices up. A couple of things Im curious about -Does this scheme actually help people get in sooner, or does it just inflate prices? -Whos really benefiting in the long run, the buyer, the banks, or the developers? -Is scraping in with only 5 down smart, or just taking on more risk and bigger repayments? Id love to hear from people who are actively trying to buy. Would you use the scheme, or would you rather keep saving for a bigger deposit? For anyone interested, I actually host a podcast called First Property Buyer Show where weve been unpacking this with guests, from finance experts to first-home buyers whove gone through the scheme.

"Figtree property agent banned and fined for serious breaches
From Illawarra Mercury  A Figtree property agent admits she made mistakes that led to her being banned from the industry for six years and fined by its regulator. Marie Maffucci is accused of misusing strata money, breaching conduct rules and failing to keep records. NSW Fair Trading said it fined and formally reprimanded her for serious breaches of her legal and professional obligations. While the alleged offences occurred a number of years ago, NSWFTs findings were only made public on August 26. In a statement to the Mercury, Ms Maffuci expressed remorse and said the incidents occurred four or five years ago during a period of chronic stress and personal strain that affected my work and led to mistakes. She said these mistakes have since been corrected and rectified. I accepted full responsibility with honesty, integrity and accountability under challenging circumstances. I have learned from the experience and am moving forward with stability and dignity, Ms Maffuci said. Ms Maffucci, who is still listed on ASIC as the owner of Net Link Strata Services, is accused of misusing money received on behalf of strata plans. A NSW Fair Trading spokesman said Ms Maffuccis six-year ban commenced on August 21 this year. NSW Fair Trading has disqualified Marie Maffucci from holding a real estate or any other property licence, or being involved in the direction, management or conduct of a licensed property business, for six years, the spokesman said. Ms Maffucci had failed to submit a trust account audit for five years, failed to hold strata plan funds in a trust account, failed to make or keep records and fraudulently converted money for her own use. She was fined 5500 for her actions under the Property and Stock Agents Act 2002. Strong actions to protect consumers NSW Fair Tradings strata and property services commissioner, Angus Abadee, said the authority takes strong enforcement actions to protect consumers. The disqualification of a real estate licence sends a clear message to the property sector. There is no tolerance for breaking regulations, he said. The dedicated resources within Strata and Property Services Taskforce ensure strong regulatory visibility across the strata industry and the ability to respond quickly when non-compliance is detected.",8,0.91,2,housing,Housing Market Challenges and Property Insights,Very Negative,1,2025-09-02 22:23:45,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1n6i0nx/figtree_property_agent_banned_and_fined_for/,AusProperty
"New to renting in Melbourne!
Hello! My partner and I have secured our first rental but were confused about the processnot sure if this is normal - can anyone clarify or let us know how things normally run? We were approved  the rental agency emailed both myself and the current tenant about rent payments, bond, exit clean etc. The agency also said To ensure a smooth transition, we would prefer to arrange a clean changeover. This would involve you completing the usual vacate and clean a few days prior, allowing us to conduct the final inspection, return your bond, and commence a fresh tenancy with the incoming occupants. However were keeping a few of the current tenants furniture, so current tenant asked if this would be a problem with the vacate clean. The agency replied saying Could you please provide us with a list of remaining items, and we will note them? Alternatively, if you prefer, you can have Levius sign off on the entry condition report, agreeing to the condition of the property, or make note of any differences and they pay you the bond. To which the current tenant opted for the latter option. However are we going to be disadvantaged because of that?

"Boundary stalemate
Alrighty, here are the facts - 3 years ago we brought a property. - 6 months later the place next door was sold and knocked down to make way for a new build. - during this process they surveyed their lot and identified that the shed we have in our backyard has been built over the boundary line. - we go back and forth and ultimately agree we will move the back wall of our shed so that it stands on our property. This will cost us approximately 40K. Its a nice shed, its worth it. - while we got our builders and council approval in place the neighbouring lot has dug down into their land before we were able to start the build. Theyve built a retaining wall a few meters away from the boundary. - originally they said they were only planning on building the 1 retaining wall and that the dirt would soon be back filled so we could start works. Now they are saying they want to build a second retaining wall on the boundary line but need us to fix the shed first. - this brings us to the stalemate as we cannot do our works until the backfill is complete without endangering the stability of our shed. Where do we go from here? I feel like their works have impacted our use of our property. Weve tried to work with the neighbour but to add to the complexities the neighbour has stopped responding to our messages. We are also in contact with their builder who says he also hasnt been able to contact the neighbour.",7,0.89,10,housing,Property Boundary and Demolition Issues,Positive,4,2025-09-01 20:26:08,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1n5l3it/boundary_stalemate/,AusProperty

Hi all, Ive just broken my lease and Im trying to work out which costs the real estate agent is actually entitled to charge.

At what point are we officially considered to have vacated the property - once the final condition report is done?

More specifically, the agent has told us we need to pay  Rent until the new tenant moves in  Break lease fee for the portion of the lease dishonoured  Advertising fee  Final inspection report  Ingoing property condition report From what I can see online, there isnt much clarity about what costs can legally be charged to a tenant breaking lease and our contract keeps the fees very broad, too. Do these charges seem reasonable? Im particularly unsure about the break lease fee since a new tenant has already been found who will be paying higher rent than we did. I dont understand how that qualifies as an actual cost to us. Ive also read that standard end-of-tenancy expenses, such as the final inspection, cannot be charged to tenants.

This would be my solution to the problem, In QLD, EnergexErgon who are the QLD energy distributors received around 4,000 - 5,000 apprenticeship applications annually. They accepted only 185. The problem isnt necessary people wanting to do trades, its getting an apprenticeship and getting practical experience to get signed off. - Mature aged workers who are locked out - Career changers who are locked out - People who cant find apprenticeships are locked out - Apprentices who are pigeonholed in one area of their trade e.g. Switchboards Electrical In QLD Ive seen Barber academys where you pay 12,000 - 15,000 for a year course in barbering. During that time you work at a Barbershop 2 days a week, there are trainers supervising you to do the work but they arent allowed to cut hair. The haircuts are free meaning theyre very popular in terms of clientele. If someone can replicate this for trades, theyd have a million dollar, potentially billion dollar idea. Edit These numbers arent fixed, obviously scale matters as well. Pay a tuition of 12,000 - 15,000 dollars a year. Work 2 - 3 days a week. 2 days on site, 4 hours theory per week. Offer jobs where you only need to pay for material. However advise the work will be done by students under supervision. 6 Students per day is 7,500 half of 15,000 is 45,000 per annum per day so 15 students is 225,000 per annum. This doesnt even include if the operation was 7 days a week, meaning more flexibility for students and extra hours to be allocated to jobs.

Posting for a friend who is a first time renter and needs some guidance with a situation thats arisen with her housemate.

They signed their 1 year lease in May so this came as a huge shock to her and shes now panicking about breaking the leasefinding someone in time as she cannot pay the full rent amount alone.

He also has indicated to her and the agent he expects that its her responsibility to find a new tenant in the next month, and that the new tenant will be paying the lease breaklease transfer fees.

Their agent is being useless and just told her she needs to find someone soon because hell be going on holiday.

Good morning! Need some insight from others put in a similar position. We moved into a new rental in the Gabba area, just over a month ago with a year fixed term lease. The house got put up for sale and sold. However, the new buyers are using the FHO scheme, where they need to move in within 6 months. The buyer went to the agents office, hat in hand asking to start negotiations on a figure to get us out within 6 months. We sent a reply asking for 17k, with a full detailed cost breakdown. We currently pay 625 for a 2 bed, 2 study rooms, 1 bath, no car We said we were open for negotiations but the cost breakdown essentially There is no guarantee that we will get a rental at the same price so we compared to similar houses on the market and they are between 7-800. Adjusted again against the projected 12 rental price increase for the Brisbane metro area we grabbed the lowest  3.8k  in projected increase rental payments for 5 months expected move out date to end of lease 5.7k  My take home pay for needing to take a week off work to move. 1.5k  Removalist, rubbish removal, carpet and bond clean. 6.7k  8 weeks rent compensation at the aforementioned projected rent price. We stated multiple times in our email that we are more than happy to negotiate, as the above prices are only estimated costs. The real estate agency came back and said hahahaha, thats fucking ridiculous, but Ill send it to them, dont hold your breath We did not add into the costs, my housemates wage loss for taking time off work or an inconvenience tax as we only JUST moved out of an absolute shitter, into a space we finally had room to breathe. We used 8 weeks compensation as that was their original offer, just that. 8 x 625 does not cover my unpaid time off. Negotiable on that front, I guess this is partly an inconvenience tax.

"Agents dodgy practice?
Hello everyone - I came across a recent scenario that isnt sitting quite well with me, thought to voice it out for opinions in interest of unsuspecting buyers - or - to educate myself on what to do in such scenarios. I came across an about-to-be-listed property in Melbourne that looked like an interesting prospect. Its odd floor plan caught my attention and I dug-up its old floor plan from a listing from a few years ago - just to compare the two. Discovered that a portion of - what was a long garage previously - was converted to a bedroom  en suite  laundry mentioned as a workshop in the recent most floor plan. Plus the outdoor covered living area was converted to an indoor living area without making the flooring dampinsect proof wooden decking slates with gaps between them for insets to crawl through. A quick phone call to the council confirmed our suspicions of that all being unapproved works. The agent confirmed that she was aware of this. I offered a fair price verbally considering all the retrospective building approvals Ill have to take and essentially redo the laundry  en suite. She promptly declined - which is fine, and said shell advertise the property in its old config and the advertised price would also reflect that. Guess what - what originally should have been listed as a 3-1-2 config got listed as a 3plus study-2-2, i.e., without any mentions of the unapproved additions. The updated floor plan on the listing has also been cheekily tweaked maybe to avoid any legal trouble. The advertised price is also reflective of a 3plus study-2-2 in the area. An unsuspecting buyer might not even notice all of this. A pre-purchase inspection might help bring this to light, but again who knows. As the agent is aware of the unapproved works, isnt she legally required to clearly mention that in the listing itself? I would have assumed so - it should be right both ethically and legally. The agent is a seasoned professional of the area - more than 20 years of experience so Im sure she knows what she is doing and can do without getting into trouble. Keen to know if this is a common practice, and how to be cautious of these shenanigans - and ways to mitigate risks arising from these things?

"Rooftop Garden bed causing Downstairs Leak.
Dear Reddit. Were experiencing a shemozzel of a roof leak only during some rain events. We do have an upstairs garden bed that runs for about 10m along the upstairs windows and the leak is occurring in the downstairs area pretty much directly under this garden bed. I dug some of the garden up and have found what feels to be approx less than a fingers width between the white window sill flashing? Ive rightly  wrongly called it flashing in my sketch. So the theory I have is that water may build up during a rain event and flowing in between the underneath of the sill and the top of the garden bed at Y in my sketch. To support this theory, weve experienced a second leak in line with the garden bed about 1.5m away from the original leak. Does anyone recognise this type of window  window sill installation? If so, would that make sense that water could escape underneath that sill? Someone suggested from the inside of the room upstairs to get a camera in through the plaster to visually the inside of the wall to find leaks. What does not support my theory is that there are some parts of the sill that the garden bed dirt is at the same level with the base of the sill as it bends towards the garden. Adding to the woes there also is a box gutter. If anyone knows this kind of setup, I would be very grateful for your advice.

"First property at 30, looking at an IP with a buyers agent. Am I on the right track?
Hi everyone, Im 30 and about to make my first ever property purchase. It wont be a place for me to live in but an investment. Ive been working with a buyers agent who has been steering me towards a two-bedroom unit in Narre Warren priced around the mid 500s. Their fee is about 16,500 which Ill be paying out of pocket. I am looking at a buyers agent because I am currently located elsewhere in Australia. I also hold the perspective that Im not a subject matter expert when it comes to property Im really not!, and just as you would take your car to a mechanic needing a fix, I am looking at a BA to ensure I get the right property solution for me. On the financial side I earn just over 7,000 a month after tax and rental income would likely top out at around 500 a week, which is roughly 2,150 a month. My main living costs add up to about 2,300 a month including rent, bills, groceries, gym, transport and the usual extras. Mortgage repayments in the scenario Im looking at would be a bit over 3,200 a month. That would leave me with roughly 3,600 surplus each month after everything is covered. What Im trying to get a better handle on is the longer-term outlook. From what I can see, most two-bedroom units in Narre Warren sell from the low 500s up to a bit over 600,000 if they are in a good pocket or recently renovated. If I buy at around 565,000, how much headroom for growth do you think there is over the next few years. In one to two years time, what sort of equity position could I realistically expect to be in. And for anyone who has been down this road before, do you think using a buyers agent for a first purchase is worth it, or would I be better off putting that money elsewhere and learning to buy on my own. This is my first step into the property market and one of the biggest financial decisions of my life. Id really value hearing different perspectives.

I recently bought the blue house still in settlement, and right after, the property next door left side was fenced off with a demolition sign. The two houses share a party wall. I checked the state planning website and saw an approved application to build two double-story townhouses there. However, theres no building or development approval yet. The selling agent told me the architect for the demo owner got my number from the sold sign and wanted to talk. I spoke to him, but honestly I doubt hes a real architect based on how he spoke. He said the chimney has a shared flue crossing onto their side, and they want to shrink it and brick it up so it still works.

"Real estate agent made me uncomfortable, how can I leave evidence without escalating?
Hi everyone, thank you so much for your time and advice in advance. Im in Sydney and recently needed to renew my lease. I am single Edit female and live by myself my family lives overseas. My landlord lives overseas, and Ive never had direct contact with him, the real estate agent REA has always been the person to contact my landlord on my behalf. Normally the landlord only signs 6-month leases with me, but this time I asked for 12 months because I have a major surgery coming up and I dont want to risk having to move during recovery. The REA who is also the founderCEO of the real estate agency came to inspect my apartment. During the inspection, he came very close to me, our shoulders were touching, he put his hand on my back and on my shoulder, looked me up and down from head to toe, and squeezed my shoulder for 5 minutes Editand keep looking at my chest while sayingrelax, you look very nervous, dont worry about the surgery, it will be fine. After he put his hands down, I stepped back immediately, but few mins later he would come pat on my back again.... at that time, I was not sure whether he was ignorant of boundarypersonal space or he was just cheering me up... Maybe I shouldnt have told them the truth about why I need to renew my lease for 12 months. But at that time I was silly, I felt I should give them a reasonable reason. I didnt say NO at the time when he was touching me because I was afraid he might influence the landlord not to renew my lease. He stayed in my apartment for an hour and had no intention to leave. I said I need to get back to work, then he left. Two days later, he told me the landlord had agreed to the 12-month lease Ive signed the new lease. I dont have any record or evidence of him touching me inappropriately that time. I have been losing sleep becuase I am afraid he might come into my apartment without permission, or asked me to move out during my surgery recovery. Since then for the last 2 months he has been texting me every couple of weeks asking if I need his help before the surgery. Ive always politely declined. This Friday he texted me again after I declined his offer of help 2 weeks ago Edit Ive advised him politely 3 times that I dont need his help, he just keep contacting me. I find this repeated unwanted contact very annoying and causing me to lose sleep. This morning I finally be courageous and texted him saying that I appreciate his kindness but prefer some personal space. Now Im worried that my text message might have upset him, and he could retaliate  for example, by influencing the landlord to end my lease early, increase my rent, or using his access to enter my apartment without permission. I really dont want to go through the stress and trouble finding a new rental place during my surgery recovery, becuase doctor advised I need at least 3 months of recovery Edit I havent had the surgery yet. At this stage, I dont want to escalate this to NSW Fair Trading because I dont have evidence of him touching me inappropriately. But Im worried that if things go bad later, Ill have no evidence of whats already happened. My question is is there any way I can leave a record of this situation without formally escalating it right now? Edit I dont know their business size, I guess its a small real estate agency, because the REA is the owner of the buiness, so lodging a complaint to the business will not help. Edit I have read all comments. Thank you so much, every kind soul for your time and messages. Much appreciated.

"Who is at fault selling agent or previous owners? And how do I go about rectifying this issue?
Hi I recently purchased a property as is, as inspected. Now the previous owners haved damaged the ceiling in a living room, and a recent storm had made the ceiling to the alfresco sink. The selling agent advised that the previous owners would rectify this prior to settlement. Now come settlement date and the selling agent advised all works were complete and dropped off the keys. He did not go through to check and left as soon as he gave us the keys. The work was dodgy af. With holes in the ceiling to the living room and the alfresco held back up with bolts visible to everyone to see. The selling agent told us this was not on and the owners would rectify this. Agent advised to get quotes for the owners to pay. Now settlement has passed I got a quote for the living room ceiling which the previous owners paid. The selling agent himself got a quote for the alfresco, now the previous owners are ghosting the agent. Now the agent is saying he cant make them pay and to take them to court. Only issue is I havent not had contact with the previous owners and have been relying on the selling agents word, they paid the first quote so I thought I had nothing to worry about.

Hi, small block property owner here in a regional citylarge town. The area is full of small workers cottages, like my own. Next door to us there is a strange half-block which comes from our back neighbour around two sides of the block, to join with our street our back neighbour has an L shape block and we are in the green house. They have just demolished the small shed and have approved plans which we have only just found out about to build a two car garage across the width of their block and going back the length of our house. This will entirely block the sunlight in the room on that aspect, and a 3.5m wall will be within arms reach about 30cm from the window. The neighbour denies that they will actually build it, but the day before said it would be turned into a granny flat so we dont believe them. The plans suggest we could claim adverse possession to slightly move the build so it is where the fence is now. But that would cost a survey as well as not really gaining any extra light to the affected room. I love the house and the area, but was considering maybe moving in a couple of years anyway.

Im 33F with a 2b2b in an inner city suburb of Brisbane bought in 2021 for 555k. My unit is worth around 750k now, with a mortgage of 315k. I earn 72k pa ex super, and I dont expect that to radically increase any time soon. Im single and not planning on changing that or having kids in the future. I dont currently rent out the second bedroom as Im working from home 3 days a week and the unit is really small. I cant stop thinking about selling the unit and downsizing to a 1b1b instead for around 550k in a suburb maybe slightly further out so like 5km from the city instead of 2km. I feel so house poor with the mortgage repayments, but I really dont want to rent out the second room as Ive had a bad experience with that before, and I really value having my own space. I estimate there would be a cost of around 40-50k to buy, sell and move, so I wonder if its really worth it when the difference in value is only around 200k. But then I think about how it would feel to literally halve my mortgage and have some breathing room, and its just so tempting. I would also love to travel more regularly, and seeing as Im in my 30s and dont want a partner or kids, nows the time!! I know I have good equity and my super is 130k for reference too so Im in a great financial position overall, but I have absolutely no liquid savings right now and it stresses me out massively. Im working on building my emergency fund back up now. Ive also had some minor physical and mental health issues in the past where reducing work hours really helped, so I feel really anxious knowing that is not an option at all in the foreseeable future. I guess I just want some objective outsiders opinions. Am I being shortsighted and emotional here? Or would downsizing be a logical step?",4,0.75,22,housing,Property Buying and Financial Decisions,Negative,2,2025-08-29 12:12:08,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1n2v8ig/would_downsizing_be_shortsighted/,AusProperty
"Final inspection  Jacana power switch-off
My parents are leaving Darwin and ending their lease. Theyre in an apartment. Real estate has requested that they keep the electricity on until the final inspection is completed. I assume that standard practice is for the final inspection to take place after the keys are returned. Jacana want to do a final reading, which theyre billing my parents 120 for  despite the fact that they have smart meters installed. In order to do the final reading, Jacana need to be provided with access to the property, which, because its an apartment, requires someone with a key to let them in. My parents have asked Jacana to get the key from the real estate since by the time Jacana do the final reading i.e. after the final inspection is done, my parents would have returned the key  to which Jacana have said, no dice, the 3rd party contractor who does this reading wont do that. The end result is that my parents now have to get the final inspection done before they return the keys, then have Jacana come do the final reading after that.

"Labors housing help risks backfiring on homeowners
PAYWALL Labor began its second term talking about rebalancing economic growth away from being government-driven to more private sector activity. On Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accelerated a plan for a government takeover of 30 per cent of the lenders mortgage insurance LMI market to purportedly help first home buyers. The partial nationalisation of LMI is a negative signal to broader private investors considering deploying capital in Australia  the same investors Labor is trying to woo to lift business investment and stagnant productivity. Labor must be judged on its big government actions, not its mild-mannered centrist rhetoric. It is doling out debt-funded taxpayer subsidies for home buyers, childcare, visits to the doctor, green industry and university students. But there is little care for taxpayers or future generations picking up the bill. LMI protects banks and other lenders in the event of a mortgage default and is typically required for borrowers with less than a 20 per cent deposit. The Home Guarantee Scheme has increased from an initial 10,000 first buyers under the Morrison government in 2020-21, to 50,000 spots under Labor in 2024-25 and will soon be available to an unlimited number of first home buyers, probably subsidising about 70,000 people a year. It reverses the privatisation of the governments Housing Loan Insurance Corporation in 1997. The expanded guarantee will be available from October 1 for all first home purchases worth up to 1.5 million in Sydney, 1 million in Brisbane and Canberra, 950,000 in Melbourne, 850,000 in Perth, 900,000 in Adelaide, and 700,000 in Hobart. The previous income limits of 125,000 for singles and 200,000 for couples will be abolished. The expansion will put upward pressure on house prices, increase the already high levels of household debt, raise the cost of private LMI for property investors and first buyers not eligible for free government insurance, expose taxpayers to risks, and possibly reduce competition in the LMI market. The policy was invented during the election campaign, based on Labors desire to be seen to be doing something about the plight of first home buyers. It must be said that the expansion of the first deposit guarantee is not as reckless as the Coalitions plan to enable mortgage interest deductibility for first buyers. Scare campaign, says Clare ONeil Housing Minister Clare ONeil says mortgage insurers are running a scare campaign. In private meetings, the insurance industry felt she scolded them for daring to publicly criticise the policy, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. She told them Labor had an election mandate. Some critics cant be so easily dismissed by her. Lateral Economics Nicholas Gruen has written a 60-page report for the Insurance Council, exposing problems and making six policy recommendations. This includes charging borrowers an insurance premium, like the New Zealand government does at 1.2 per cent of the loan value to underwrite the scheme. Gruen was an adviser to former Labor industry minister John Button in the 1980s. He also happens to be the brother-in-law of Treasury Secretary Jenny Wilkinson. His daughter has worked for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. Hes hardly an anti-Labor crusader. If the government goes free insurer, its pretty obvious thats not good policy, Gruen says. His report estimates that the scheme will initially bring forward annual home buyer demand by 20,600 to 39,100 people, 90 per cent of whom would have been able to afford a home in future years by buying LMI or receiving assistance from their parents. As a result of the government-fuelled stimulus, national house prices could rise by between 3.5 per cent and 6.6 per cent in 2026, and as much as between 5.3 per cent and 9.9 per cent for market segments targeted by first buyers. The short-term price increase is likely to be larger than the benefit the scheme saves most first buyers, Gruen estimates. The timing could be better, with interest rates falling, migration strong and now this policy, he says. Over five years, the price effect will be largely neutral after the temporary bringing forward of buyers is followed by demand tapering because most people who used the scheme would have bought later anyway. Conveniently, Treasury estimates released by the government omit the short-term price impact that Gruen calculates. Over six years, the government says Treasury estimates that the scheme will increase home prices by just 0.5 per cent, including the supply benefits of 55,000 affordable and social homes that Labor has yet to build. University of Queensland economist John Quiggin argues that the scheme has the perverse effect of the government being incentivised to support higher house prices  the opposite of what aspiring first buyers want. The government will be liable for billions of dollars of insurance payouts to banks in the event of any future housing market crash that leaves defaulting borrowers in negative equity, Quiggin says. It gives government a strong incentive to make sure house prices dont fall, he says. Another overlooked problem is the detrimental impact on the insurance market. The government nationalisation of the first buyer LMI market could reduce competition and push premiums higher for property investors and first buyers not eligible for the scheme. It could lead to the farcical situation of the government crowding out the LMI market, and then the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Treasurer Jim Chalmers potentially blocking the merger of LMI players that cannot financially survive. LMI providers have high fixed costs of about 45 per cent of their total operating costs, Gruens report estimates. With private LMI activity forecast to decline by 30 per cent, premiums will need to rise 19 per cent for the providers to maintain current profitability. Any premium increase will affect non-FHBs first home buyers and FHBs who do not meet the eligibility requirements...where they buy a property with a value exceeding the property price cap, Gruens report says. Helia chief executive Michael Cant says LMI providers will need scale in a smaller market. A smaller market makes it harder for everyone to have the critical mass to continue what were doing, so LMI providers will need to be leaner and fitter going forward, he says. Txpayers taking on undisclosed risks Another flaw is that taxpayers are taking on undisclosed risks, according to Alex Sanchez, a former economic adviser to Albanese and a former policy manager at the Insurance Council. The government is taking so much risk on its balance sheet with housing, Sanchez says, also pointing to other policies such as the 10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. Treasury has not disclosed the contingent liability of the deposit guarantee, which Gruen estimates could reach 62 billion by 2030. In the event of a large recession accompanied by a property market crash, where 5 per cent of first buyers default and the government has to cover 15 per cent of the property values relating to mortgages in default, the government will be liable for 3 billion in payouts, Gruen estimates. Such taxpayer bailouts will almost certainly occur at the same time that the government is spending tens of billions of dollars on supporting other parts of the economy, potentially including banks. Treasury views the risks as low. Borrowers will still have to undergo credit tests from banks, meaning not all borrowers with a deposit as low as 5 per cent will automatically receive a loan, despite the impression the government gives. Only a few borrowers have defaulted under the existing scheme. But this has occurred during low unemployment, and national house prices have risen 45 per cent over five years, according to property data firm Cotality. There have been very few buyers defaulting in negative equity. LMI providers paid out claims of only 296 million between 2019 and 2024. However, the payouts were fourfold higher, at 1.2 billion, between 2014 and 2019, when interest rates were higher and unemployment worse, according to industry figures. Payouts have been 2.8 billion over the past 15 years.

"Can my brother and I use our deceased mums superannuation to purchase our first home?
My brother 18M and I 21M have recently lost our beloved mother unexpectedly over a month ago and were stuck in a tricky situation where we need to make a decision that will impact our whole lives. As the title suggests, we will be receiving our mums superannuation, as well as her estate. We were set as her binding nominations, as well as the two people mentioned in her will. Well be taking away 50 each. Were both receiving a generous amount of money, just enough to potentially buy our first home. We live in Sydney and have known it our whole lives, and we are both aware of how incredibly expensive it is to live here, as well as the housing crisis. My brother and I are currently staying at his girlfriends parents place and have been since mum died, as we were previously living with her and renting. We had to vacate the house fairly quickly so we wouldnt have to pay for several weeks of the absurd rent price. Im forever grateful for my brothers gfs family for providing us with a roof over our heads, but we obviously cannot stay forever. We would both prefer to purchase a house to live in, for several reasons. As the value of houses drastically increases and doesnt seem to stop, it would be a better choice for both of us financially if we ever decide to sell. Another reason is that our mums dog, a big and lovely chocolate lab has also been given to us and he will need a backyard to run around and go to the toilet in, to give him the best life possible. Both of us would also put up with any maintenance we would need to do to keep the house tidy and clean. While we will be receiving a large sum of money, it would still not be enough to purchase a house around the area we have lived our whole lives without our dad helping out by selling his own house our childhood home. He would also need to pay off his mortgage before helping us out as well. Hes spoken to us and seems pretty keen to sell his place in order to help us find a home. We dont want to move into his place as he lives with his partner and her daughter and dont want to crowd the house too much. We also strongly value our privacy and need a quite place to call home. We have looked at moving to the Central Coast and continuing our lives there, as houses are sometimes half the price. But thats a question for another day. This is a lot of info to read, I know. But I hope this covers the general idea of our current plan. I am unsure when we will be receiving our mums estate and super money, but on the off chance that it is soon, could we even use that to buy a home? Would buying sooner rather than later be a better idea as well, as I am also aware of the governments new scheme arriving in October that will likely see house prices increase even more. Would it be better for us to wait and utilise the scheme ourselves, or would it be better to buy beforehand if we had the option to?

"Lease-breaking questions
Hello all--my partner and I rent an apartment in Sydney. For life reasons, we have to leave Sydney and break our lease. Because we have only been in the apartment for a few months, the break-lease fee is equal to four weeks of rent. In order to avoid paying this, we have been trying to arrange for a lease transfer. We have sent three separate applicants to the REA, but the landlord keeps rejecting them. I do understand not all applicants are desirable tenants, but if the applicants are employed and able to provide good references, Im not sure what the issue could be. My gut tells me that REA is hoping we will give up and pay the break-lease fee so the landlord can then rent out the apartment to someone else and likely raise the rent. One of the reasons provided by the REA is that the landlord may want to do renovations on the unit. That said, the REA is being very stingy with informationexplanations.

"Sydney? Townhouse might sell before the weekend pre-auction, when can I possibly do BP? Or not one at all?
This is my first rodeo in terms of making a serious offer, but Im trying to stay level headed despite things in NSW moving just 80x faster than I like to move. I recognize theres some aspect of this that is simply just how the game is played. Found a townhouse slated for auction that checks all my boxes, have viewed 2x only listed on Saturday, have had my solicitor review contract  strata, all good. I am preapproved. I have done research on previous sales. Im interested in making an offer, although it will stretch me on the high end of my range I think it could be a good one. But few places Ive seen so far have checked as many boxes as this one so it seems worth it...except what I havent done is a BP, and this is a townhome that pretty much stands on its own like a house and in a tiny group of 4, so Im worried strata wouldnt have picked everything up. The problem is that the REA has informed me that they expect the property to sell before the weekend, in part due to demand the inspections were mobbed, but also because the owners are retirees who just put a deposit down on a retirement villa and dont want to pay double. I believe theyre motivated for a pre-auction sale. Im guessing whats going to be needed is a hard and fast 66W if my verbal offer is accepted. Given its essentially Thursday now, should I just assume ? that getting a BP before Saturday is going to be nigh impossible, whats the best course of action? 1. Ignore the before the weekend timeline, order a BP anyways, and risk it cant get done before it sells, be out the 400 bucks 2. Submit a higher offer but that is conditional on BP rarely seems to work in Sydney 3. Walk away 4. Proceed with 66W if verbal offer accepted, BP be damned, rely on strata and visual inspections only. My gut says Given this is stretching the high end of my range, I cant risk 4. Skipping BP should probably only be considered if I am getting a comfortable price range, to account for the funds Id need to cover a possible serious issue e.g. sewage.

The convergence - Rate cuts giving variable holders 400month back per 100k borrowed - Home Guarantee expansion unlimited places, no income caps, 5 deposits - Help to Buy supporting 40,000 buyers with 2 deposits - Sidelined buyers with 18 months of pent-up demand returning But heres the bigger picture - even with these tailwinds, we might be approaching the mathematical ceiling of what the population can actually afford. From 2003 to 2012, house prices remained fairly steady with the price-to-income ratio stable, tracking income growth for nearly a decade. Weve seen this before - once you exhaust buying power, markets can go sideways for years. At current income levels, even with 3.35 rates and 2-5 deposits, were looking at 80 of the population being completely priced out of major metros. The policy settings feel designed to extract every last dollar of buying capacity before that ceiling hits. The question Are we seeing a coordinated push to squeeze the final growth phase out of this cycle? Once youve maxed out buyer capacity with sub-3.5 rates and minimal deposits, where do you go from there? History suggests we could be looking at another decade of stagnation once this sugar hit runs out - similar to how regional markets flatlined through the 2010s after their affordability limits were hit. Whats everyones take - final hurrah before a long plateau, or can this momentum sustain beyond the policy boost?

"Change of title in off the plan property contract
Hi guys, I have signed an off the plan property contract with a developer in NSW a couple of years ago. In the Title Structure section, it clearly marked no for the question Will the lot form part of a community? Today I got a notification from the vendors solicitor informing that the settlement is getting close and the council has issued them Community titles for the development. I was shocked because I was under the impression that my lot will be under Torrens title from the beginning. I get my conveyancer to send my concerns but the developers solicitor come back saying that they have clause in our contract that allows them to amend any documents including the Disclosure Statement and they quickly send me copy with the title section changed to Community title. Isnt this misleading? I am so upset and want to cancel the contract and get our deposit back. Does any one has any idea what shall I do ?

"Is this a conflict of interest?
Wondering what my legal grounds may be to exit an exlusive agency agreement for a rental property I own. Context I just finished renovating it after 12 long months and contacted the agency I purchased through to rent out the property. They have encouraged me to rent out to someone they have who is looking for a property exactly like mine prior to advertising the property, advocating that they would make excellent tenants, that they are great applicants and recommended I approve the tenancy. Theyre also super keen to save me the advertising fee. The rental price they offered was less than what I expected, so I turned it back asking them to advertise the property for so  so amount. They said these applicants would be happy to pay the price I mentioned and then said but I dont think you will get any interest if you do advertise it at this amount. I said please proceed with advertising the property and they have hesitantly agreed. I have since learned that this prospective tenant is a sibling of the property manager and believe its a conflict of interest and that they are not acting on my behalf.

"When to notify BC about my dog? Owner-occupier
Bought my first apartment in a strata title, and I settle in a couple of weeks. I was hoping to wait about a week before moving in, but circumstances have changed and now Ill need to move within two days of settlement. I have a dog and Ive been very transparent with all involved through every part of the process. In NSW a strata cant blanket ban pets anymore, but can choose which bylaw to implement, either 1 Residents are allowed to keep an animal as long as the resident provides written notice within 14 days of the animal first staying in the scheme. 2 Residents are required to get written approval for the animal from the owners corporation and the owners corporation cannot unreasonably refuse permission. If they do refuse, written reasons for the refusal must be provided. I have 2. Im not worried about refusal - there will be no reasonable refusal options for a middle-aged chipped, neutered and vaccinated greyhound with no behavioural issues - but I am worried about where hes going to stay while I wait to hear back. Boarding would be incredibly stressful and expensive, and none of my friends or family could do more than a couple of days. My solicitor says I shouldnt apply until I have the keys in my hand, which is consistent with the advice Ive been given from the REA. The strata manager who I had to ask directly for the forms because their website is horrible and the links are broken has said that I should submit the form ASAP. I dont want to start my relationship with my neighbours on a bad note, as Id like to join the committee myself, but also I love my dog. Also side note does it typically cost money to have a committee meeting? Ive got friends in different strata committees with the same bylaw who just tick a box on a web form or thumbs up react a WhatsApp message. I think my strata manager can smell that Im new to this and is just trying to make a quick buck off me. I know this doesnt call for an EGM which would incur a cost.

"5 deposit change is irresponsible and unfair
The recent change to home deposit requirements is irresponsible, principally unfair and does almost nothing to help would-be home owners. It is irresponsible as the macro conditions increase the risk of defaults among highly leveraged homeowners. There is currently very low unemployment below what the RBA estimates to be consistent with inflation at target, extremely weak private sector growth, fairly low interest rates and a very real chance that of significant job losses due to AI in the next 5-10 years. Much of the strength in the labour market and in growth is in the non-market sector, which is unsustainable and unlikely to continue over the long term. The Government is assuming a large amount of risk, at a time when that risk is very high. It is principally unfair as the taxpayer now underwrites all of this risk. This policy directly crowds out the market solution to highly leveraged borrowing LMI, in doing so, effectively nationalising borrowing insurance for a lucky few individuals. The allocation of this subsidy is not equitable as borrowing constraints dictate that relatively high income necessary. Further this subsidy allows those who have sufficient income, but insufficient saving habits, to take on a fair bit of risk most of which they do not face. Its not particularly clear why the Government has decided that the market solution is insufficient, or why it is advantageous to nationalise LMI. It does almost nothing for would-be home owners as individuals will still face the primary borrowing constraint of income level and will now be competing with even more individuals for the same housing stock. Obviously to the extent that there is take-up this policy will add to demand though tsy modelling probably suggests they think take-up will be minimal which will price out those on lower incomes partictuarly those who have been able to save sufficiently. The principle constraint to purchasing that is within an individuals control is income, as it dictates borrowing capacity. This is unchanged. I am not suggesting that it would be good policy to relax the income related borrowing regs, but if giving people access to the the necessary funds is the principal concern, this policy fails to do that. obvs relaxing borrowing regs has similar downsides to this policy, but at least individuals would bear the risk. In case anyone thinks it is relevant, there is a good chance that I will personally benefit from this policy.",40,0.84,26,housing,First Home Buyer Deposit Scheme Discussion,Very Negative,1,2025-08-27 13:34:13,https://reddit.com/r/AusEcon/comments/1n16kyk/5_deposit_change_is_irresponsible_and_unfair/,AusEcon

"What Type Of Advice Are You After?
I am a fully qualified accountant specialising in tax for property investors and am also a mortgage broker. I have found the two go together well as I have seen many examples of banks or brokers completely ignore the tax implications of lending structures when there is an investment component. Further, I have noticed the poor quality of advice that is out there being screamed from the highest points by those who are either not qualified to know any better or are simply seeking attention by being the loudest in the room to funnel, often unknowing, investors into a sales process designed primarily to complete a transaction rather than truly help anyone. I am curious as to what guidance  advice property investors are seeking over and above what an accountant would usually do compliance. I am building a tiered service model to cover the investor journey from starting out to complex multi-property portfolios, with varying levels of education, touch points and reporting. The idea is to provide a wholistic service ongoing and to meet clients at the level they are at and provide relevant support to help get them where they want to go, rather than force them into a sales funnel with a one size fits all solution and cookie cutter advice. As we are in the build phase we have our own thoughts but it can be hard to test the market, wondering if anyone cares to mention what they have found helpful or would find helpful and pay for as advice in the property investor space. Keen to hear your thoughts on how we could build something better. When you respond I promise to not bombard you with offers. Rather I will thank you and give you credit if your ideas make the cut...

"I am simultaneously grateful and regretful for buying my apartment.
Its been almost a year since I bought my first unit and I am both grateful for buying it and having my own home but also regret it for opening up more side quests. I am grateful because I know the rental market is shit right now and the prices of property just keeps rising so if I waited longer I would have been priced out. I bought a 90s spacious brick building so its spacious enough that it doesnt feel cramped like newer builds. Its also close to work and within walking distance of a giant park and a major shopping centre as well so there are perks to it. However like every new home owner with buyers remorse I have quickly found out there are ongoing costs other than bills. Within a few months of moving in I had to change the water heater, found out the waterproofing in one of my bathrooms is broken and finding smaller cosmetic nitpicks I didnt initially pick up. On top of that I want to renovate both the bathrooms, kitchen, laundry and change the flooring and wardrobes so its going to cost quote a bit. Costs aside its also the bureaucracy of getting approval from strata which will be annoying and praying the builder or building company isnt dodgy. Sometimes I wish renovations worked the same way in a video game where once I have the money I just press a button and instantly get a new bathroomkitchen. But in saying that the options were either buy a newer build which will likely have defects or buy an old build and fix it up over time. It seems old buildings with brand new interiors are unicorns in the market.

"Australia housing crisis Nicolette Boele rejects NIMBY status, but says new housing must not give residents a raw deal
Ive recently been labelled a NIMBY for pointing out that a community in my electorate felt blindsided by suddenly revised plans to radically revamp development at the heart of its village. This is a story about two things the profoundly complex nature of the housing crisis, which sees the haves and have-not-yets pitted against each other, and the temptation for commentators to sensationalise this conflict. While the NIMBY versus YIMBY frame is a clever exercise in branding and media shorthand, it works against, rather than for, much-needed solutions. Commentators push the public discourse on housing into a false binary either preserve neighbourhoods or build more homes  youre either a NIMBY or a YIMBY. Oscar Colman During the 2025 election campaign, our volunteers knocked on over 30,000 doors from Northbridge to North Turramurra. The single biggest issue that people wanted to talk about was housing. And although there were as many views as doors knocked, the unifying message was that we need to build more of them  affordable, quality homes built sensitively, sustainably and close to infrastructure. Because school teachers should not have to billet a room in their students family homes due to a lack of suitable rentals in Killara. Because essential workers should not be dangerously fatigued from a 90-minute commute each way between their homes on the Central Coast and their jobs at Royal North Shore Hospital. Because families and communities should not be forced to fracture when kids have to leave the area, knowing that saving for a deposit to buy a local house is a waste of time. I believe that most people understand that the single biggest lever to making homes more affordable is to increase supply. But they also understand that housing supply only works if it is matched with the local infrastructure that supports daily life  schools, transport, and public green spaces. Otherwise, we are supplying new and existing residents with a raw deal. Thats why I find it challenging when commentators push the public discourse on housing into a false binary either preserve neighbourhoods or build more homes  youre either a NIMBY or a YIMBY. Local input ensures development delivers more than extra dwellings  it creates neighbourhoods people actually want to live in. Complex problems require complex solutions, and housing is no exception. Labels shut down debate and, worse, divert energy from fixing the systems that could make housing viable. Last year, following a lengthy community consultation process, Castlecrag Progress Association and Willoughby City Council supported a redevelopment of the Quadrangle Shopping Village into a five-storey residential shop-top complex. Residents were consulted. They flagged issues with traffic, school capacity, and public space. The final design was improved to reflect that input. A few months into demolition, the same site was on-sold to a new developer who resubmitted plans for an 11-storey tower under the NSW governments state significant development rules. Having already contributed their perspectives on what would work, the community is frustrated that the process appears to start again. Local schools are full. The suburb has only one main road in and out. It is not on a train line. Bus services are woeful. These issues remain, but now, the goalposts have shifted. And how does this play out  NIMBY or YIMBY? The Support Lindfield group has spent over a decade giving the community a voice in shaping their villages future. When plans emerged for the Lindfield Village Hub on an old council carpark site, they did not oppose development. They accepted the need for taller buildings, even the jump from nine to 18 storeys. What mattered to them was that growth be carefully planned, with social and green spaces, parking, and other essential infrastructure being included, so families could stay in the area and the village remained liveable. Local input ensures development delivers more than extra dwellings  it creates neighbourhoods people actually want to live in. The best outcomes are achieved when we combine growth with local and expert knowledge of what needs to be maintained and what needs to be expanded to keep neighbourhoods thriving for the next generation. That only comes through meaningful engagement. That is how you turn housing into a village people want to belong to. NIMBY versus YIMBY framing does not help this cause. It reduces complex questions to a culture war while the real problems  bottlenecked planning, under-funded infrastructure, skills and labour shortages, short-term politics  get off scot-free. Meanwhile, people who are ready and willing to work, save, and contribute remain locked out. We know that increasing housing supply is key to making housing more affordable. We should also know that the housing crisis will not be solved with labels. It will be solved with innovative solutions such as build-to-rent-to-own, better master-planning, and genuine community engagement that makes places fit for the people who live in them  old and new neighbours alike. That  not unhelpful labels  is how we make sure our villages are places for people, and not just property.",29,0.82,95,housing,Housing Crisis and Solutions in Australia,Negative,2,2025-08-25 10:54:41,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1mzctc6/australia_housing_crisis_nicolette_boele_rejects/,AustralianPolitics

"Sydney housing crisis Minns concedes not everyone will welcome citys new train station and homes development
Premier Chris Minns has conceded his governments plan for 10,000 new apartments in Sydneys eastern suburbs wont be met with universal happiness but he says his plan for a major rezoning of Woollahra and neighbouring Edgecliff cant be stopped. After much speculation, Minns on Sunday announced Labor would open a new heavy rail train station at Woollahra while rezoning land there and in nearby Edgecliff for high-rise development to provide 10,000 new apartments in the leafy eastern postcodes. Premier Chris Minns at the site of the planned heavy rail station at Woollahra on Sunday.CreditSitthixay Ditthavong Minns said land within 800 metres of the new station and 400 metres of Edgecliff would be rezoned for the new homes, which would probably be delivered over 10 to 15 years. Located close to Sydneys CBD and existing infrastructure such as St Vincents Hospital, the new station was first built in the 1970s but it never opened because of local backlash. The truth of the matter is, to combat Sydneys housing crisis, everybodys going to have to do their bit, he said. We cant have a situation where the rapidly growing western suburbs take the majority, or nearly all of Sydneys housing growth when weve got fixed infrastructure in other places closer to Sydney. A train passes through the half-built Woollahra station.CreditLouise Kennerley The premier said he expected the maximum height under the changes would be on par with an existing 21-storey development in Woollahra. Most, though, would be less than that. But, he said, the government did not have a number for how many towers would need to be built to reach 10,000 homes. That will in some ways be determined by property developers and builders, he said. We will get estimates as a result of this rezoning master planning process. It was less than two years ago that the government defended not including Edgecliff in the original group of transport-oriented development sites it earmarked for major rezoning because of what Planning Minister Paul Scully described as limited sewer and water infrastructure and a railway line operating at high capacity. On Sunday, Minns said the advice from Sydney Water had changed. The advice now was that there was ample evidence and space for extra development when it comes to the water infrastructure thats in place  in fact, far, far more than the 10,000 thats been notified. Play Video   Play videojavascriptvoid0  An abandoned train station in Woollahra is set for a major development to help build 10,000 new homes in the suburb. Minns said he did not know how that advice had changed so dramatically since December 2023, though he said perhaps the agency had got it wrong originally. Similarly, the government now says the eastern suburbs railway line between Bondi Junction and Sydney CBD has the lowest passenger usage rates during the AM peak of any line on the Sydney network. In 2023, Scully said it was operating at high capacity, providing data showing the number of passengers passing through the end of the line at Bondi Junction dwarfed Lidcombe in western Sydney. Woollahra, just three kilometres from the CBD, was originally planned to have a stop on the eastern suburbs rail line until backlash from locals led the government to abandon the project in the 1970s. The government has resurrected the plan, saying Sydneys housing affordability crisis and the fact that Woollahras population had fallen justify a major housing boost in the area.  Related Article  NSW State Parliament  No-brainer Architects, developers ready to pounce on Woollahra ghost station The government has said some housing will be mandated as affordable, but it has not given a firm figure. Minns said it would be up to 10 per cent. Woollahra Mayor Sarah Dixson, who has been critical of the plan to open the new station, questioned who would be buying the new apartments, given that two-bedroom units average between 1.5 million and 2 million. The only people getting excited about this announcement are the developers, who by the governments own admission will be leading this project, giving them a blank cheque to build luxury apartments in Sydneys east, she said. The government has also said it will institute a value capture mechanism on new apartments in the rezoned land of between 12,500 and 15,000, which he said would represent a fair return on the 150 million to 200 million it would cost to build a new heavy rail station. For a return on the taxpayer investment, for an uplift in development and more housing and more opportunities, this just makes enormous sense for us and for NSW, he said. It also makes political sense for Labor. While polls show most voters support increased housing supply greater density is far less welcome among some residents in well-heeled eastern suburbs addresses such as Woollahra. The government will on Monday announce 200 million in infrastructure grants for local councils tied to how quickly they assess development applications. The grants, which were first announced by the government when it unveiled new housing targets for councils last year, come as new data shows the time councils take to assess development applications has fallen by a quarter in the past 12 months. The new data shows a 24 per cent reduction in assessment timeframes, with the average DA now taking 83 days on average.  Related Article  Opinion  Property development  In an electorate that screams privilege, an MP needs to pick a side on the housing crisis  Alexandra Smith State Political Editor Vaucluse MP Kellie Sloane, opposition health spokeswoman, is seen as a possible future leadership contender for the Liberal Party, and the government has invested considerable energy seeking to paint her as anti-development. She has fought back against that claim, saying, for example, that the government should seek to build higher in neighbouring Edgecliff. On Sunday, she said Woollahra was a pro-housing suburb, but she said the government was wrong to say the suburbs infrastructure was underutilised. The local school is already at capacity, the roads are choked, half of the people here already live in flats and apartments, she said. The opposition has questioned how the government came to its figure of 10,000 new homes. With 10,000 new homes in this suburb, you would need to have 95 21-storey towers. Its a pipe dream, and it doesnt seem very realistic, she said.",37,0.93,95,housing,Woollahra Station and Housing Development Plans,Negative,2,2025-08-25 10:09:07,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1mzbug9/sydney_housing_crisis_minns_concedes_not_everyone/,AustralianPolitics

Sydney is insane price wise as you all know but we want to stay where we are around the inner south west. Good value 3br places dont come up too often. 1.6m houses dont seem like good value to me and we dont want to take on that much debt. Looking at units or townhouses in the 900k-1.1m price range. I found a 3br unit right near a future metro station bankstown line off market which is perfect in many ways, but my wife doesnt like a few things about it. Shes also cautious about taking on debt whilst she doesnt work. I think I can get it for 950k. It has a tenant until Feb 26 so would have to be an IP at least to start with. Ive tried selling the idea to my wife by saying we could potentially negative gear it until we are ready to sell our current place and move in we actually quite like our current place. I think prices around the area will sky-rocket once the metro is done so Im keen to buy. Even if we dont end up moving in it could be a great investment. Can anyone help me with arguments I can articulate to my S.O., or suggest a different course?

" NEED YOUR WISDOM! New Build vs Capital Growth - Which Would YOU Choose?  First Home Buyers Seeking Advice! - 800K Ormond Apartment - Smart Move or Capital Growth Trap? 
Hello everyone. Hope everyones enjoying their weekends and is working on their investment future. I have a massive question for the group... My wife and I are about to put an offer in for a corner block 2-bed 2-bath apartment in Ormond, VIC as first home buyers. The apartment is one of 17 other apartments, so its a relatively small development - they are brand new... So well get the stamp duty off the plan savings. Body corp is only 2,500 PA. There are actually 2 apartments the ground floor apartment - 122 sqm and the top floorpenthouse apartment 116 sqm - 788k and 815k respectively. Reasons why we like this A. Location - we think Ormond is a great South East VIC suburb location. B. Its brand new. C. The ground-floor apartment is very cozy andor the top floor apartment has a massive balcony just above the canopy and unobstructed sky on a corner block... Question What do you guys think? Well never be able to get a new build at that price in a location like this... BUT... over to you  Would love to hear all your thoughts. PS Yes we know ZERO capital growth... but this will be our home for the foreseeable future. However... are we making a mistake here by buying an 800k home with no potential future growth which will mean nowhere to go on the property ladder?

"Labor pauses building code in first post-roundtable move
  Labor pauses building code in first post-roundtable move Aug 23, 2025  10.30pm Housing Minister Clare ONeil says the housing code pause was not at the expense of building standards. Nicole Reed Housing Minister Clare ONeil on Sunday will announce the four-year pause to the NCC for residential buildings as well as plans to fast track the assessment of more than 26,000 homes currently waiting for approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Builders have complained that the 2022 update, which included significantly improved energy efficiency standards, caused a sharp rise in construction costs and project complexity. Labor hopes the decision to pause the NCC will help it get closer to meeting its target of building 1.2 million homes between June 2024 and June 2029 under the National Housing Accord. The National Housing Supply and Affordability Council in March said it expected the federal and state governments to fall 262,000 homes short of the goal. Labor attacked Opposition Leader Peter Duttons election-campaign pledge to freeze the NCC for a decade, warning it could risk a Grenfell Tower inferno. But it insists its own proposed pause is different, since it lasts only four years and would still allow for changes to essential safety and quality standards. Labor will also look at using artificial intelligence to improve the usability of the NCC and remove barriers to the uptake of cheaper housing methods, including prefab and modular housing. Pausing the NCC had almost universal support at last weeks roundtable. The only holdout was Australian Council of Social Services boss Cassandra Goldie, who argued that pausing changes to energy efficiency standards could lead to higher power bills.Outspoken Labor backbencher Ed Husic also warned that the pause was misguided since it would increase the number of changes that would eventually be made when the freeze ended. To fast track the assessment of the 26,000 homes waiting for environmental approval, Environment Minister Murray Watt will establish a specialist team within his department to review the backlog. The Environment Department will also trial the use of artificial intelligence to speed up assessments. ONeil said it had become too hard to build a home, and insisted the NCC pause was not at the expense of building standards. In the middle of a housing crisis a generation in the making, we want builders building good quality homes of the future  not figuring out how to incorporate another set of rules, she said. Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn welcomed the NCC pause. Australians urgently need more affordable housing, so its good to see action on some of the ideas from the economic roundtable so quickly, he said. Property Council chief executive Mike Zorbas said the announcement will help unlock tens of thousands of new homes across the country. The wheels fell off a nationally harmonious residential construction code several years ago when states determined to go their own way in their own time, Zorbas said. The necessary residential code recalibration will achieve the national consistency we all know is the key to an efficient housing production pipeline that must be regularly updated to meet the advancing quality, safety and sustainability expectations of Australian families.",49,0.89,105,housing,National Construction Code Pause and Housing Approvals,Negative,2,2025-08-24 06:56:31,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1myct7y/labor_pauses_building_code_in_first/,AustralianPolitics

"A sad tale of housing 4.5 Years, Same Budget, Totally Different Reality
Full disclosure this is one of those many posts whining about house prices. A few years ago, a friend of mine decided to buy his first house and asked me to help him find one. Back then, I was genuinely amazed by the sheer number of fantastic houses available within his budget of 620K. In the end, he bought a place for exactly 620K in Greensborough for those not from Melbourne, thats a leafy, respectable suburb where people actually want to live. The block was 630 square metres, was very close to the train station, and just a short walk from major supermarkets and shops. Sure, it was a bit old, but hes been living there happily ever after. At the time, I nearly shat myself with excitement. I thought, Is this how easy the Australian dream is? Well, Ill just buy something similar once I finish my studies, and start a family. I was practically giddy. Fast forward 4.5 years. Ive finished my masters, got myself a decent job with slightly above-average pay, and started house-hunting in the same price bracket. And what do I find? For the same money, I can now treat myself to a dilapidated shoebox so far out in the wasteland it might as well be in another time zone. In less than five years, my potential lifestyle has gone from The Sound of Music to Mad Max, complete with dust storms and the occasional marauding bandit. And the government? Oh, theyre busy handing out streets to property investors like candy. They basically hand entire streets to property investors, some of whom now own so many that theyre into double digits.

"Hotel operator conduct in mixed use apartment building - is this reasonable?
We purchased an apartment in Melbourne in a mixed use building privately owned hotel rooms  residential apartments. I thought this would be a benefit from a security perspective having reception attended for 12hrs per day, as our kid lives there while studying. Seems I was very wrong. The hotel is managed by a chain who is providing crisis accommodation to charities. Weve had our car parked in our basement carpark for 3 weeks in the past 6 weeks and it has been broken into twice. As confirmed by police, the first was a crisis accommodation guest and the second is understood to be an associate of a crisis accommodation guest. The first attempt they tried to steal the car and caused a lot of damage which required the car to be towed for repairs which took several weeks. I dont know what damage has been done this time, as we live interstate and our kid isnt there at the moment. We know it has a smashed window and probably stolen items based on the other cars broken into. During the first break in, there was all kinds of antisocial behaviour that occurred in the reception - use of the fire hose to clean a motorbike, defacating in reception, people fighting in reception etc. Within the last couple of months weve also had our letterbox broken into and parcels stolen the mailboxes are accessible to all guests. I appreciate crisis accommodation is an important service and concerns raised to the hotel have resulted in them asserting their right to conduct business. The owners corp is upgrading CCTV and making some upgrades to the fob system to track who swipes in, but this seems like it will only enable them to more easily identify the offenders, not treat the risk of them occurring. Hotel guests require access to the carpark to use the rubbish bins. There is a workaround for this but it will cost money and take 6 months. At what point is it unreasonable for the hotel to not take measures eg increased security at their cost, at the continued safety and expense of others?

"Call for desirable spare bedrooms to be taxed to help fix housing
PAYWALL More than a quarter of households contain one person, but 6 per cent of homes are one-bedroom apartments or studios, leaving some with few affordable housing options. The most common household type is two-person, a third of all. The most common dwelling size is a three-bedroom home, Cotality research found. More than 60 per cent of households have one or two people, in contrast to the popular idea of the nuclear family. But most homes are family-sized  three-quarters of homes have at least three bedrooms. Cotality Australia head of research Eliza Owen said there is a mismatch between the number of people per household and the number of bedrooms per house. Households have evolved over time, so that housing stock probably was once really suited to households, but over time as children have flown the nest and average household size has declined, households have more bedrooms than they might utilise just for sleeping, she said. Its hard for developers to take risk in different housing types because that three-, four-bedroom model has worked for so long  it might be hard for risk-averse lenders to assess demand for this kind of housing, especially in context of the off-the-plan apartment boom in the 2010s, which is housing that has not performed well. Owen emphasised that there is nothing inherently wrong with a home having more bedrooms than people, and space for a home office, future children, visitors or hobbies. But she wondered if there was some inefficiency in the way the housing stock is allocated, and what might happen if those extra bedrooms were taxed. Its perfectly acceptable and desirable for people to have spare bedrooms, she said. But you could ask them to pay for it through land tax or you could incentivise them to move on through the abolition of stamp duty or some combination of both. It seems unfair to ask younger households to pay higher and higher prices for stock that is being utilised by older households. She acknowledged that suggesting someone move out of their family home and downsize is a big ask. But it is a big ask for younger families who cant get into this housing stock because its being utilised by smaller household sizes. The research comes as this weeks economic reform roundtable in Canberra considers how to speed up new home building to meet the federal governments target of 1.2 million new homes in five years, which is running behind. Attendees on Thursday expressed support for reducing red and green tape to speed up home construction. Separate Reserve Bank research found that if Australias average household size returned to 1980s levels, 1.2 million fewer dwellings would be needed to house our population. Quantify Strategic Insights head of data and insights Angie Zigomanis thought there were challenges in trying to make sure the upcoming pipeline of homes fit the actual size of households. In an ideal world, youre trying to build as much diversity as possible, a mix of one-, two-, three-bedroom apartments, townhouses and anything else, he said. In the current market, its just unfeasible to develop apartments  to get any development off the ground, you really need to find a way to make developments cheaper to build. He highlighted recent rises in construction and labour costs, which have meant it is most feasible for developers to focus on luxury apartments for wealthier downsizers. Someone is selling a 3 million house to buy a 1.5 million apartment you can make a 1.5 million apartment stack up, but you cant make a starter apartment stack up for 600,000. Developers need to achieve a certain amount of pre-sales before they can build an apartment project. But he noted owner-occupiers often hesitate to buy off the plan, then construction can take so long that a young buying couple might have a toddler by the time they take the keys. Zigomanis said one way to overcome this could be to reproduce a NSW plan where the government will guarantee a set amount of apartment pre-sales to help developers get the bank loans they need to start construction. Ray White chief economist Nerida Conisbee said as houses have become more expensive, more households have been considering apartments instead, a trend she expects to continue. She added that to hit the 1.2 million new homes target, more people will need to live in higher-density homes.

"The startling data that proves how the tax system helps the old
Australians are retiring with unprecedented levels of wealth. This wealth, primarily held in housing, superannuation and investment properties, allows retirees to draw incomes to support their retirement. As Australians have become wealthier, we might expect government spending on social safety nets for older Australians to fall. Instead, we have seen these programs grow in real, per-person terms. The net result is that older Australians have much higher incomes than previous generations of retirees. Twenty-five years ago, the average 75-year-olds post-tax and transfer income was little more than 75 per cent of an average Australian income. Today it equals the average Australian income. Older Australians also enjoy a post-tax income one-third higher than Australians aged 18-30. This astonishing fact has important implications for the efficiency and sustainability of our tax and transfer system. The evidence The tax and transfer system treats people differently at different ages. Individuals receive benefits from the state as a child, then contribute more in tax than they receive in transfers while at their most productive, before once again enjoying an excess of transfers later in life, as their productivity declines and they enjoy retirement. This lifecycle pattern is shown here. In our research, we first measure how the lifecycle incidence of private income has changed in the past three decades. This calculation includes income from all sources, including capital gains from housing and superannuation. It shows that earnings have grown at all ages and our peak earnings continue to occur in our 50s. It also shows that Australians are earning more passive income in retirement today than in earlier periods. Finally, we can add together the private income with the net impact of the tax system to find the average post-tax income of Australians at different ages. This shows that the nature of the tax and transfer system has fundamentally changed in the past three decades. In the earlier periods of our study, older Australians earned relatively little income, while the tax and transfer system provided income through the aged pension and in-kind support to give them an income similar to those at the beginning of their working lives. In contrast, todays average 60 Australian has a substantially higher private income and receives substantially more from the tax and transfer system, leaving them with the post-tax income of an average 40-year-old without the pressures of saving for the future or supporting a growing family. The intergenerational contract has lost its balance.  Five implications The evidence is stark the Australian governments relative expenditure on older Australians has increased significantly in recent decades, funded by those of working age. This significant change in the nature of the Australian tax and transfer system and the age profile of post-tax and transfers income distribution has several and serious implications for the future of Australia, of which we highlight five inter-generational equity broader tax and transfer design including lifetime income smoothing housing policy and budget sustainability. 1. Rising intergenerational inequity As Australian retirees have accumulated significant wealth and associated capital income, the Australian tax and transfer system has not adjusted. It has instead increased support to this cohort. As a result, Australians over the age of 60 now enjoy a post-tax income similar to that of mid-career working age Australians and much higher than Australians aged 18-30. If the primary goal of redistribution through the tax and transfer system is to reduce variation in access to economic resources across the population in simple terms, taking from the well-off and giving to the needy, then current system violates this principle redistribution results in higher average income among older Australians than among younger cohorts. The imbalance is even worse when two other factors are taken into account. First, younger Australians need more income to build up assets e.g. paying for a home older, asset rich Australians require far less income to maintain equivalent standards. Second, our research doesnt account for the costs of raising children. In fact, by including transfer payments in the income of child-raising Australians which only partially account for associated costs, it disguises that additional and large contribution to imbalance. 2. One third of income is currently untaxed Australias tax and transfer system design focuses primarily on personal and corporate income taxation, placing far less emphasis on income from savings. As a consequence, rational economic behaviour has increasingly shifted wealth into forms subject to little or no taxation, to the point that only about two-thirds of income is still captured by the tax system. The absence or restricted nature of taxation on income generated through owner-occupied capital gains, superannuation, and imputed rent, coupled with the increase in transfers to older Australians, leaves government with little option but to raise further revenue from those generating taxable income. As it stands, that is from working age Australians, in particular by leveraging bracket creep. Government should implement taxation policy changes to broaden the tax base and capture for taxation the one third of total income, overwhelming accruing to older Australians, that is currently untaxed and as a consequence rapidly growing. 3. Older people are dying with big super balances Governments often choose to support individuals to even out the amount of income they have throughout their life. This implies policy that will tax citizens most highly when they have the means to pay, and transfer to citizens more support when they most need it. Failure to implement such policy in Australia is evident from the difficulty younger Australians face buying a home and raising a family while contributing 12.5 per cent in superannuation, and from the older Australians enjoying, unencumbered, similar levels of income and often dying with significant superannuation balances. 4. Housing price rises benefit older people Increases in house prices over the past decades have increased the wealth of older Australians, generating substantial growth in private income in the form of both capital gains and imputed rent. This income has come at the expense of younger Australians and migrants buying into the housing market, effectively keeping them poorer for longer potentially a lifetime longer. Addressable government policy is responsible for much of this inequity  Preferential tax treatment of housing increases demand for this asset class and pushes up prices.  Zoning and planning regulations limiting new housing supply contribute around 40 per cent to the price of houses in Sydney and Melbourne and a quarter of all land within 10km of Sydneys CBD is subject to heritage protections.  Policies that discourage older Australians from downsizing include capital gains exemption for owner-occupied housing means test exemptions for owner-occupied housing rates and utilities subsidies for older Australians ageing in place programs the lack of a broad-based property tax and stamp duty. Therefore, to the extent that housing prices are driven by government policies that restrict land supply, these policies should be reversed as a matter of urgency, generating large equity and efficiency gains. 5. The budget is not sustainable The current tax and transfer system, with its growing obligations to the growing cohort of older Australians and shrinking resources from which to meet those obligations, is spiralling down and unsustainable. As the governments obligations to older Australians in pensions, aged and health care benefits, etc increase relative to GDP, government will need to increase taxation on the productive sectors of the economy most obviously through bracket creep. Postponed childbearing, exit from the workforce and other consequences will reduce the relative size of the economys productive sector, ultimately exacerbating the problem to the point of disaster. Clearly, policy must address this downward spiral sooner than later.",37,0.95,23,housing,Intergenerational Equity and Housing Affordability in Australia,Very Positive,5,2025-08-20 12:42:18,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1mv2z2q/the_startling_data_that_proves_how_the_tax_system/,AustralianPolitics

"FSBO - For Sale By Owner
Hey everyone, Ive been working on an idea for a website where you can list your own property for sale  kind of like Gumtree meets realestate or domain but more modern and all without having to pay an agents commission. It would be a self contained marketplace for sellers and buyers. Itd be For Sale By Owner FSBO, so youd handle the sale yourself, but the site would give you the tools  Easy listing upload photos, AI assisted price guiding, and AI assisted description, with an option to engage a professional photographer  A dashboard to track views  enquiries and schedule inspections  Guidance on contractspaperwork so youre not lost or option to engage with a Conveyancer and have them draw it all up  A flat fee less than 1k instead of the 2-3 for an agent The idea is to make it simple, transparent, and way cheaper than going through an agent  especially for people in regional areas where agents charge high fees but dont always deliver. Curious  Would you ever use something like this to sell your home?  What would make you feel confident enough to try it?  Any deal breakers that would stop you?

"Tax penalises workers and helps retirees, Chalmers told
PAYWALL The tax system penalises workers who are struggling to afford homes and raise families, while being overly generous to people when they retire, an expert will tell Treasurer Jim Chalmers economic roundtable. Australian National University economist Bob Breunig will propose a flat tax of between 7 per cent and 20 per cent on personal savings and investments, such as interest, dividends, rent, superannuation and trust distributions to make the system fairer and simpler. The family home could also be included via a broader land tax under one of the models suggested. The current tax-free threshold of 18,200 would be restricted to wages and salaries, and would not be available for personal savings and investments. The extra revenue raised from a uniform taxation of savings and investments could be partly used to take pressure off personal income tax for working-age people, Breunig told The Australian Financial Review ahead of his appearance at the tax session of the roundtable on Thursday. The tax system is penalising people in their 30s and 40s and then making them super wealthy towards the end of their life, and they could probably use a bit more of that money when theyre paying for childcare and trying to get a mortgage, he said. If we tax savings a bit better it means you can improve equity and can also afford to cut the corporate tax rate to increase productivity. Corporate tax could also be reduced for companies not earning high profits, such as outside banking and mining, to stimulate business investment and boost productivity, Breunig said. The findings are broadly in line with a Treasury paper released this month for the economic roundtable. Treasury warned of a growing reliance on taxing working-age people via bracket creep in the decades ahead, while pointing to tax concessions for superannuation and capital gains mainly benefiting wealthier and older people. Only 16 per cent of Australians aged 70 and over paid income tax in 2022-23, down from about 30 per cent in the 1990s, Treasury said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has ruled out imposing new tax changes that Labor has not sought an electoral mandate for, but has left open the door to taking tax ideas from the roundtable to the next election. I dont expect that you will solve all of those issues in the next three days, but what you will have is ideas and input that will shape that agenda and shape that public discourse as well, Albanese told the 23 participants to kick off the roundtable in the cabinet room at Parliament House on Tuesday. An updated ANU research paper co-written by Breunig shows that government spending, such as on the age pension, aged care and healthcare, has increasingly benefited older Australians in recent decades. At the same time, seniors have earned significantly more private income, primarily as a result of real estate and superannuation. In the first 10 years of the study 1993-94 to 2002-03, people aged over 60 had private income equal to 41 per cent of the income of people aged 18-60 and average final income after tax and government transfers equal to 61 per cent of the younger cohort. In the final 10 years of the study through to 2022-23, the pre-tax income of people aged over 60 had jumped to 65 per cent of the population aged 18-60, and post-tax income was equal to 95 per cent of their income. The trend was even more stark for people aged 18-30 compared with those over 60. To achieve a fiscally sustainable budget over the coming decades, Australia must choose between increasing taxes and reducing government expenses, Breunig and his co-authors Peter Varela and Matthew Smith wrote. The consequences of this adjustment should be borne, at least in part, by older Australians. Achieving budget sustainability solely by increasing taxes on Australians of working age mostly by growing personal income tax revenue through bracket creep will worsen generational imbalance in the tax and transfer system. The ANU economists proposed more means testing of government benefits, such as including the value of the family home in the asset test for the age pension and increasing user fees for aged care and healthcare. A flat tax on savings and investments could be as low as 7 per cent if a land tax was broadly applied to the principal place of residence. If the family home was excluded, a 15 per cent tax on savings and investments would be required to be broadly revenue neutral. A tax rate of 20 per cent could pay for reducing the corporate tax burden, through a proposed cash flow tax known as the allowance for corporate equity. The advantage of an ACE is that it will tax economic rents, such as in mining, banking and other sectors earning these high returns, Breunig said. Treasury said this month the high 30 per cent company tax rate could deter investment, hurt jobs and reduce wages.",55,0.89,44,housing,Intergenerational Equity and Housing Affordability in Australia,Negative,2,2025-08-19 13:44:57,https://reddit.com/r/AusEcon/comments/1mu7szw/tax_penalises_workers_and_helps_retirees_chalmers/,AusEcon

This has been fine up to last year, my usual afss guys wont sign off because they are now interpreting the schedule to say that one side of the property may need fire hoses never had them since built in 1970s. They recommended a fire certifier they know to consult who wants 2400 just to have a look. I spoke to another afss inspector for a second opinion. They told me to raise a DA or DO with the council to have them straighten it out? Im so lost with this situation. I feel like the first guy is just trying to help his certifier buddy make some easy money, but option 2 I worry that whatever a DADO is they might assess my building to modern fire standards which is unfair.

"First Home Buyers Guarantee Explainer
Hi, Ive seen a couple of posts lately about a few things and thought this might be handy for a few. The First Home Buyers Guarantee is a government program that helps first-time buyers get into the market faster. Basically, it lets you buy with as little as a 5 deposit and skip paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance. The government effectively guarantees up to 15 of the propertys value, so your lender treats it as if you have a 20 deposit. This can save buyers tens of thousands in LMI costs and potentially give access to better interest rates. This is different to the Government owning a percentage of your property. They are only guaranteeing your lending which means they are protecting the bank from loss. Key Features  Minimum deposit 5  Owner-occupied purchases only  You must live in the property  Not all lenders are participants in the scheme NAB, CBA, Westpac are your majors and then theres another 20 second tier lenders Eligibility current rules  Australian citizen or permanent resident  Singles earn up to 125,000 p.a.  Couples combined income up to 200,000 p.a.  Must not have owned property in Australia before  Must meet property price caps based on location Property Price Caps 20242025 financial year  NSW Capital city  regional centres  900,000  Other areas  750,000  VIC Capital city  regional centres  800,000  Other areas  650,000  QLD Capital city  regional centres  700,000  Other areas  550,000  WA Capital city  regional centres  600,000  Other areas  450,000  SA Capital city  regional centres  600,000  Other areas  450,000  TAS Capital city  regional centres  600,000  Other areas  450,000  ACT 750,000  NT 600,000 Whats Changing on 1 January 2026? Key note, not yet legislated From Jan 1, the FHBG is getting a big upgrade.  No more income caps  Price caps are increasing to 1.5m in Sydney, 1m in QLD  ACT, 950k in Vic, 900k in SA, 850k in WA, and 700k in TAS. Its a super handy scheme for anyone saving but just not quick enough to keep up with price rises. You do need to have at least 5 plus Stamp Duty. Stamp Duty charges vary across the country but we often use the stampduty.calculatorsaustralia.com.au calc to work this out. Ensure you answer yes to First Home Buyer to get an accurate figure but once youve got your stamp duty and 5 saved plus 3000-4000 for conveyancing and other costs, youre probably ready to go from a savings point of view.

"New house bought in September 2024 - does a non-working screen for floor heaters and a remote for outside heaters which has rusted, qualify as a defect that can be claimed within the two years?
We bought a house in September 2024 built around a couple months before we purchased. Im aware of the 90 day completion warranty, then there are 2 years for minor defects. Also aware that we shouldve realised these issues beforehand but just wondering our options. From my reading it relates to the functionality of the house. We have floor heaters which are accompanied with a panel. One of these panels do not work i.e. have a black screen. Previously one of these were cracked and display didnt work, but was replaced in the 90 day period. I checked the price to replace one of these and its around 300-400, and the consumer warranty is 1 year. We also have heaters for the backyard area which can be turned on with a remote. We basically werent aware of these and wanted to use it these months when it started getting cold. I checked the remote wasnt working and the battery compartment is rusted. No instructions were provided when they handed these to us so we didnt know what belonged to what. We were in a rush moving houses so thought it was an old remote not used. Theres a multitude of shoddy craftsmanship which we realised after we bought the house i.e. some gaps arent cleaned up properly, shoddy paint job showing up after heavy rain, and screwstoilet fixtures showing rust after less than 6 months of use, which they have agreed to fix after the 90 days. Weve requested for these two additional things to get fixed and they told us to directly contact the manufacturersupplier ?, and said that everything was working fine at the time the keys were handed over, which they definitely were not considering they admitted to it directly by agreeing to repair the defects. They said the remote is not in stock and the screen should be replaced by ourselves.

"Do Australian tenants have any rights?
I live in a small granny flat in a small town near Wollongong and as I rent the place I have to agree that the real estate agents do inspections from time to time. Since the responcible agency has changed I had my second inspection in two month now. Firstly I now that it is completely legal what they are doing but it just doesnt want to go in my head that such an intrude in someones privacy is accepted. They dont ask permission they just give you notice and take heaps of pictures or your apartment including your personal belongings. Top of it was the second inspection where I received the following message Following the recent routine inspection of the property at XXX. We would like to thank you for taking care in maintaining the property. During the inspection there were just a couple of areas that require a touch up  The stove top would benefit from a further clean  Toilet could do with a touchup Thank you so much for your understanding and effort in upholding the home. Why the f do you care about how my place looks like?! I am neither a messy nor a horder, I just didnt do a deep clean for an inspection. So there were some stains on the stove from making burgers the night before and dust on the toilet tank. Nothing crazy. Of course, once I move out I will leave the place like I received it at the start, but during my stay that is none of your buisness, how I live and what I do as long Im not bothering someone or destroy the property.

"How to value a rezoned plot? Sydney, Inner West, approved for 10 stories.
A few years ago, my family and I invested in a property in Sydneys inner west. My aunty and uncle who are part of the group that invested also own the property next door.

The council have now approved the land for a build of up to 10 stories. The idea is to sell both plots of land to a developer. Weve had the land valued approximately 900 square metres, but that doesnt take into account the potential ROI a developer could benefit from.

"Buying an apartment from 2016
Hello everyone, Long time lurker and first time poster here. Desperately needing advice as Im seeing both red and green flags in buying my first property in the Parramatta council. I am looking to purchase an apartment unit and have put down a 2k EOI refundable to hold it. Received a strata report and a draft contract from the sales agent. At this point everything looks good. The inspection went great - albeit inexperienced, everything looked like it was working well  Capital works fund is also 100k But as I am researching and reading the fine prints of the strata. Unfortunately from my research, the apartment is Built by Dyldam developments - went into administration in 2022, very very bad reviews Certified by Dix Gardner - NSWs most fined certifier..  The complex was built in March of 2016, coming into 10 years. So about the sales situation. It looks like they are selling around 20 units - out of 300 total. All units were previously just rented out, and now as I have been told, the developers would just like to sell them instead of renting. -To me this sounds legit and property history says its legit  There is also 5 boards at the front of the complex with SOLD stickers all over. There is a 45k rebate on them, due to them wanting to retain the value of the property. -Almost sounds like they are rushing to sell?  Now the sales agent spoke to me yesterday saying developers do not want to release the unit yet because its a showroom.. and we will either have to wait or look at other units  At this stage, Im looking to get my finances sorted out with my broker. But because there is no contract yet, I am not at the stage of hiring a conveyancer to look over the documents. Sorry for the long post! For anyone that has bought an apartment in Sydney in the past or recent, a few questions I have is Is it suspicious that they are selling 20 out of 300 units all of a sudden? Because its going to be the tenth year next year, is there going to be insane unreasonable special levies that might have been hidden from the strata report?

"The cost of housing, how is it feeling?
Hi all, Im sorry in advance if I upset some people by asking about this, as Im a Kiwi and not a born Tasmanian. I have visited your beautiful home several times and Im absolutely in love with it! My ultimate goal was to move there from New Zealand, but the main thing stopping me is the cost of housing there. I started planning my escape from here a little over 2 years ago, at the time housing seemed to be in a range I could purchase at with a mortgage, but since its gone up considerably from what I see online. Im just wondering, how are you feeling regarding the cost of housing? do you feel like you have a chance at home ownership with the wages youre able to get? Are jobs easy enough to come by if youre motivated enough to find one? As an outsider looking over the ditch I havent visited since last year, it appears that because of how unaffordable housing is on the mainland in places such as Perth and Sydney, Tassie houses have been going up almost by default, following the trend on the mainland. Is this correct? I just cant believe the average house price in Hobart is 730k AUD now. Where I live, you can get reasonable homes for as little as 250k AUD. From what I see incomes are quite a lot lower in Tassie compared to the mainland, yet house prices in some of the larger towns are not even that far behind places like Perth that are in the grossly unaffordable housing category, yet their incomes are higher. Anyways, apologies in advance, I know many Tasmanians are receptive to immigrants but at the same time I understand that people moving to your lovely country does sadly make housing more expensive for you until supply catches up. The same thing has been happening to my town. Housing has over doubled in price here in the last 6 years. Some places require a mortgage thats 9 times household income here. Ive somewhat lost hope in the idea I could ever build a future here. Sadly it seems like you guys are in a similar position to us too. Thanks if you have any info to share, I genuinely appreciate it.",6,0.61,38,housing,Housing Affordability Crisis,Positive,4,2025-07-29 09:32:26,https://reddit.com/r/tasmania/comments/1mbvy7w/the_cost_of_housing_how_is_it_feeling/,tasmania

"What If the Government Never Fixes Housing? Then What?
Lets get brutally honest about something everyones thinking but nobodys saying out loud. Sydney house prices require 13.8 years of your ENTIRE income your parents needed 4.5 years in 1970. I see that there is an upcoming Economic Reform Roundtable asking for budget neutral productivity ideas. But heres the uncomfortable truth What if Labor, Liberal, Greens, independents etc whoevers in power for the next 20 years just... doesnt fix this? What if they keep making the same empty promises, announcing the same toothless policies, while property investors get richer and we get poorer? What if this IS the new normal and more families are just permanently locked out of owning a home? So here are the questions nobodys brave enough to ask Is homeownership actually a human right, or just something our parents generation convinced us we deserved? Should we reform or make changes to financial and banking structures to focus more on renting instead? I guess whats the point of a requesting a mortgage then? Perhaps we make it easier for people to get loans to start businesses or invest in other parts of the economy? Should the government guarantee ownership, or just guarantee quality, affordable rental housing for life? What if we stopped chasing mortgages and started demanding employers provide housing allowances like they do phones and laptops? What if we collectively decided that spending 30 years in debt for a house isnt freedom, its financial slavery? And heres the big one Why are people so terrified of limiting investment properties or removing their tax benefits? What exactly are they scared ofthat houses might become homes again instead of portfolios? That young families might actually be able to compete?",80,0.96,102,housing,Intergenerational Equity and Housing Affordability in Australia,Very Negative,1,2025-07-28 19:09:31,https://reddit.com/r/AusEcon/comments/1mbbaux/what_if_the_government_never_fixes_housing_then/,AusEcon

Its a big decision. We like the idea of the cooler weather and close immersion in nature, but will we get itchy feet in years to come and regret our decision? We dont need much to be happy and I really do think we are made for the Tassie lifestyle. Is it difficult to find a community of friends? We dont want to end up feeling isolated.

"Landlord flips it at our 2000kwh power bill. Am I in the right?
Relevant to Tassie. Our winter. Aurora energy prices and graphs. Bills are included in our rent. Its off the books, cash in hand bank transfer. Hes threatening to up the rent, kick us out etc. We are three singles living in a three bedroom house. No fireplace so heating is entirely electric. Poor insulation. Two of us are gamers. We dont abuse the bills included system, its just how it is and Im not about to cut heating usage and get sick. In the past I have paid much larger power bills than normal over winter. Thats normal. But our landlord seems to think it isnt. And he might have a point. This is because he has referenced the average use of a three person household to be roughly 1100kwh as seen on the bill. Ive argued that could be based on a family of three. Being mum and dad in one room, a child in another. With half a fireplace and half decent insulation if we are going on averages. Not three singles in three bedrooms with no fireplace, poor insulation and two gamers. This time last year which I wasnt around for, the graph shows it as 1600kwh when there was an average of 2.5 renters coming and going. Am I right to take this position? Is the landlord in the right? Im feeling like we both might have a point, but I really am sick of housing. Cant get a legit rental as a it is too expensive and cant put up with off the books rubbish. Of course an option is to have no bills included and lower the rent but from my experience this isnt a great selling point for off the books rentals, and ends up pushing the value down towards legit real estate rentals. EDIT. This is for just under three months. Roughy 17 a day with a roughly 1,400 bill, so a bit less than 3 months. Should have said that before sorry. I think it does include hot water as well. Electric stove and oven. EDIT. Theres people commenting comparing theirs as significantly lower, but I want to remind you on the context and comparing apples to oranges. In no scenario would you be paying 3 dollars a day for four bedrooms, poor insulation, no fireplace, no solar, electric stove and oven, a daily access fee, no discounts, etc. Please take your passive aggressiveness out somewhere else.

"Would cutting immigration alone be sufficient to solve our housing crisis?
By now it seems pretty clear at least to me that cutting immigration from our current highs would significantly help with housing affordability. The 2025 State of the Housing System report does note that if the population grew 15 less, we would be having a 40K housing unit surplus. However, is cutting immigration alone sufficient to solve the housing crisis? Or would we need supply side interventions e.g. upzoning as well? To be more specific, would pegging net migration to a fixed percentage below our construction rates negate the need for say... upzoning? The same 2025 report does suggest upzoning as one of the solutions.",28,0.75,65,housing,Immigration and Housing Prices in Australia,Neutral,3,2025-07-12 04:32:53,https://reddit.com/r/AusEcon/comments/1lxelcf/would_cutting_immigration_alone_be_sufficient_to/,AusEcon
"Rental growth slump could impact RBA policy analyst
PAYWALL A slowdown in rental growth across Australias major cities could indicate further interest rate cuts from the Reserve Bank and a better financial year for tenants, analysts say. Capital city rental prices have slowed or stalled in the last quarter, with both house and unit median prices recording no change when totals are combined, according to Domains June quarter rent report. Rental prices rose nearly 40 per cent after the pandemic hit and this is the first time since 2019 that house rental prices nationally have remained stable for 12 months. It is signalling a turning point in the rental cycle. It is relatively significant, Barrenjoey head of economic forecasts Johnathan McMenamin said. It has macroeconomic implications, particularly for RBA policy. The rental market is a really key indicator of underlying inflation in the broader economy and, because of its weight in the CPI, a slowing in rental inflation could indicate further RBA easing in the coming months and quarters. Sydney recorded a slight 0.6 per cent quarterly change in median housing rental prices, but Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart recorded no change. For units, Sydney recorded a 2.1 per cent quarterly change while Melbourne held steady. McMenamin said the slow rental growth was because people were reaching their affordability limit. Their wages arent growing as fast as they were in the year prior, and thats basically putting a cap on how much people can spend on their rent. Were seeing an increase in household size, so that means that there are more people sharing houses, fewer people looking to keep a study or spare bedroom, and youre seeing a softening in demand through that slowing in density. Landlords were also feeling relief from the last interest rate cuts, and they did not feel the need to pass on costs to renters, he said. McMenamin did not think it would discourage housing investors, as they were always looking for tax benefits such as negative gearing properties. Next financial year better for tenants Domain research and economics chief Nicola Powell said the rental market outlook was much better than previous years. I think ultimately we have seen a slowdown in rental growth, and I think that ease is really driven by affordability caps, rather than the seasonal winter low, Powell said. She predicts a better financial year for tenants as rental vacancy rates hold steady. We are pretty much seeing vacancy rates move away from their record lows across all of our capital cities. I think theres a little bit more choice now coming onto the rental market, and that is going to slow down the pace of rental price growth. Powell said demand on the rental market was easing slightly due to the expansion of Labors help-to-buy housing policy, which is a shared equity arrangement where the federal government will make a contribution towards a buyers property purchase in exchange for a share in the property. First-time buyer incentives are probably helping some tenants, and are going to continue to help some tenants transition to home owners. Powell and McMenamin both noted that population growth has slowed, which is also contributing to the slowing in rents.",7,0.68,2,housing,Impact of Negative Gearing and Rental Market Dynamics in Australia,Negative,2,2025-07-11 09:13:37,https://reddit.com/r/AusEcon/comments/1lwrapj/rental_growth_slump_could_impact_rba_policy/,AusEcon

Ive also read that others being in more difficult situations shouldnt stop me from reaching out. mid 2023 I lost a good secure retail job.

This one taught me 2 things about myself. Im not emotionally stable enough to work solitary overnights, and heavy physical labour may be behind me. I had sharp stinging pain In my shoulder for the last half of the shift.

"Australian vegetable suppliers face court action from ACCC over alleged price fixing
PAYWALL Four large fresh vegetable producers and some of their senior executives face federal court proceedings brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over allegations they engaged in price fixing while supplying German discount chain Aldi. The alleged cartel conduct involved price fixing in the supply of broccoli, cauliflower, iceberg lettuce, cucumber, Brussels sprouts and zucchini to Aldi stores in NSW, Victoria and Queensland between 2018 and 2024. A cartel exists when businesses agree to act together instead of competing. The ACCC on Monday started civil proceedings in the federal court against Perfection Fresh Australia, the nations second-largest fresh vegetable supplier. It also named Hydro Produce Australia, a fresh produce wholesaler and grower based in NSW Victoria-based wholesaler Veli Velisha Fresh Produce and Velisha National Farms and Victoria-based M. Fragapane  Sons, which trades under the name Fragapane Farms, in the court action. Velishas director and chief executive Catherine Velisha and senior sales manager Kaushik Vora were both named in the court action, along with Frangapane Farms general sales manager Roberto Nave. Cartel conduct, whether by coordinating prices or agreeing on terms of bids with competitors, is anticompetitive, and is illegal, ACCC chairwoman Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. In this instance, we allege that price fixing conduct involving some essential household vegetables took place across three states. Protecting competition in our fresh food supply chains is extremely important to drive price competition for the benefit of Australian consumers. The ACCC alleges that on 28 occasions, two or more of the suppliers made, or attempted to make, arrangements aimed at fixing, controlling or maintaining the price of these vegetables. It also alleges that on 48 occasions, one or more of the suppliers then submitted prices to Aldi in accordance with these arrangements. The price fixing allegations are mostly in relation to agile supplying, where producers submit weekly quotes to the supermarket chain for fresh vegetables. Perfection Fresh said in a statement it is working with the ACCC to resolve the proceedings. It would not be appropriate for Perfection Fresh to provide further comment on the matter while it is before the courts, a spokesperson said. Perfection Fresh remains committed to conducting its business with integrity, transparency, and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Catherine Velisha said Velisha Farms plans to defend the claims. The allegations being made by the ACCC are very serious, and we do not accept them. We have retained lawyers and intend on defending these proceedings, she said. Velisha Farms remains focused on supplying high-quality fresh produce to all our customers including Aldi and supporting our growers, partners and employees as it has done for many years. Sheena Vinden, a lawyer representing Hydro Produce, said the company is cooperating with ACCC but was not making any admissions or able to discuss the case. Fragapane Farms were contacted for comment. Earlier this year, Cass-Gottlieb foreshadowed the ACCC has a number of cartel investigations underway. Last week, the court upheld an ACCC cartel fine against the nations largest steelmaker BlueScope Steel for attempted price fixing in 2013 and 2014. The regulator this year also brought a case against Downer EDIs Spotless and rival contractor Ventia Services over alleged price fixing.",21,1.0,3,cost_of_living,Price Increases and Market Manipulation in Australia,Very Negative,1,2025-09-01 17:43:35,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1n5ij6q/australian_vegetable_suppliers_face_court_action/,AustralianPolitics

"RBA bombshell exposes grim reality for Treasurer Jim Chalmers ahead of productivity summit
PAYWALL Lower pay rises, weaker consumer spending, softer business profits and a handbrake on living standards. Thats the bleak outlook for Australia as the nations productivity slumps ahead of Treasurer Jim Chalmers economic roundtable next week, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia. For the first time since the pandemic, the RBA has slashed the economys medium-term growth potential, by cutting its labour productivity growth assumption to 0.7 per cent, from a previous overly rosy 1 per cent. Even resorting to the 20-year average productivity growth could be too optimistic, given there has been zero productivity growth since 2016. Under this grim reality  which Australians have already been experiencing  the RBA is conceding that people will enjoy a slower improvement in living standards than their forebears. Economic growth per person and real income gains will be lower than past generations enjoyed. Lower productivity growth means slower growth in business revenues, household incomes and ultimately demand, the RBAs quarterly statement on monetary policy says. In a message to the union movement and employers, the RBA says that as a result, average annual earnings cannot sustainably grow more than 3.2 per cent  down from the previously assumed 3.5 per cent  without stoking inflation. Moreover, weak productivity growth means the economy can only grow at a mediocre 2 per cent a year, the RBA warned. This is at least 50 per cent slower than the stellar 3 per cent to 4 per cent economic growth rate from the 1990s to the mid-2000s, more than half of which was generated by Australias world-leading productivity performance under the Keating and Howard governments. Productivity grew at an incredibly fast 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent annually. The past golden era was underwritten by the computer and internet revolution, and a series of major economic reforms in tax, competition and labour markets, which lifted Australias per-person incomes to among the highest in the world by the turn of the century. Productivity measures how much output the economy creates for a given quantity of inputs, such as capital, natural resources and labour. As productivity increases, the economy can produce more goods and services for a given set of scarce resources. It is the secret sauce that allows workers to earn higher real pay, consumers to enjoy lower prices, and businesses to make higher profits. Treasury has long assumed economic growth comes from the three Ps population, participation and productivity. Participation has been largely tapped out, following a significant increase in womens workforce participation. Productivity has been stagnant for about nine years. Hence, most of the economys growth now comes from population increases, largely due to immigration, which the RBA assumes delivers about 1.3-1.4 per cent GDP growth about 70 per cent of total economic growth. But population growth does nothing to improve per-person living standards. The economic pie is growing mainly due to population increases, but the pieces of the pie are barely growing in per-person terms. This is Australias post-pandemic reality that must be confronted by Chalmers, business, unions and community groups at the three-day economic roundtable next week. They will discuss economic resilience, productivity and fiscal sustainability, including the tax system. The RBAs reality check should make the roundtable an all-out assault on efforts to lift Australias stagnant productivity to revive living standards, particularly for younger and future generations. To be sure, the productivity problem is global and central banks in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand have also downgraded the productivity outlook. The reasons are complex. In Australia, the post-pandemic productivity slump is largely due to millions of workers being deployed to the non-market care economy, which has recorded no productivity gains in two decades. Over the longer term, there are many other reasons. Non-mining business investment since the 2008 global financial crisis has slumped to levels not far above early 1990s recession levels as a share of GDP. Fewer new tools and technologies in the hands of workers makes them less productive in producing goods and services. Productivity Commission chairwoman Danielle Wood blames at least five factors the rise of the non-market services sector dominated by the care economy smaller gains from technology stalling investment declining economic dynamism and, finally, lack of appetite for economic policy reform. Governments appetite for reform has diminished since then the 1990s, and this means were leaving productivity-enhancing reforms on the table, Wood said last month. Artificial intelligence in the workplace offers new productivity possibilities, but technology adoption alone cannot be relied upon. Chalmers and his fellow travellers must confront what is in the governments control and use the RBAs productivity bombshell as the burning platform for reforms to lift living standards. Australians deserve a brighter future than the grim new reality.",11,0.72,17,cost_of_living,Australia's Economic Challenges and Productivity Concerns,Very Negative,1,2025-08-12 16:24:43,https://reddit.com/r/AusEcon/comments/1mo16rk/rba_bombshell_exposes_grim_reality_for_treasurer/,AusEcon
