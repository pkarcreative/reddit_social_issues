"Petition and Protest for Zero Immigration Until Housing is Affordable
Hi everyone, Like many people on this subreddit, I am a millennial Australian who is devastated by the insane property price rises that have made buying a house impossible. So I am trying to do something about it. After extensively studying this issue, I have found that the only way we can restore housing affordability while we are still young enough to have kids is to reduce immigration. And the more we reduce immigration, the quicker we can end the housing crisis. The reasons for this are outlined in a Substack Post that I wrote, which references economists who have made similar statements. As a result, I have started a petition calling for Zero Immigration Until Housing is Affordable. The petition contains exceptions for skilled construction workers, clinical healthcare workers, and other exceptional circumstances. The full text is shown within the petition, and this currently has over 11,000 signatures. Additionally, I have organised a protest calling for Zero Immigration Until Housing is Affordable, including getting police permission. This will take place on July 12 at Sydney Town Hall, from 11 am to 1 pm. The full details are shown on the Facebook event and this currently has 200 responses. I truly believe that if enough of us stand up for ourselves, we can force the government to end the policy of excessive migration that is destroying housing affordability. As Millennials and Gen Zs now make up 47 of voters and 54 of voters want house prices to fall. The UK and Canada have recently frozen immigration because their people protested, which proves this is possible in Australia too. So if you agree, please sign the petition and share it with others. Thanks for your time to read this, and if youre in Sydney, I hope to see you at the protest!",2,0.55,5,housing,Australian Housing Dynamics and Policy Developments,Very Negative,1,7/3/2025 20:28,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1lqm5ir/petition_and_protest_for_zero_immigration_until/,AusProperty
"Compensation from rental provider
Hi all, Just after some insightadvice into my current situation. A bit of backstory. Basically my toilets have stopped refilling. I have been manually filling the cistern with a bucket a few times a day, so they are still functional just not automatic. After notifying my REA, they organised a plumber to come out and assess the problem. The plumber diagnosed that the toilet runs off tank water, and the pump sensor is likely faulty, so is not refilling when it should. They also noted that there should be a mains water backup, which is not working, likely due to a blocked manifold. I think. Not my area of expertise so I may have the terminology wrong. The plumber told me when they came out, was not informed by the REA. Anyway after a few days with no news I emailed the REA to confirm the plumbers report, they responded that quotes were being obtained, and confirming that they had received the report. That was 22 days ago. I recently purchased a house and have given my REA notice that we will vacate in a month. At this point I feel like Ive done my job of informing them of the problem. I suppose my question is, if I dont remind the REA about the issue, am I liable for leaving the property in a damaged state? Also my partners coworker said we might be able to claim compensation from the REA? Can anyone confirm or deny?

"Duplex - are they truly treating affordability.
People are forever arguing with me that a duplex is cheaper than a house, which is fair when comparing like for like. But for the most part people arent buying a duplex built in the 80s. Older, more affordable properties are being bought and turned into a duplex, today. Every argument I ever hear is ignoring the affordability of a suburb being turned into a duplex city 1 house bought, halved, a great big property built on it, and sold for greater than the price of the house, for each side. If this happens, the median shoots through the roof, and has been. Am I wrong? I believe the true cost of a city like Sydney isnt even being realised, and should make people sweat. If someone with money can do this to a property year on year, the true cost of property is far higher than what we are looking at today, am I wrong? What are the young people of the future supposed to do in 20 years, if this is 5 years. 1. House sold 1.42M  1a. Duplex sold 1.985M  2. House sold 2.53M  2a. Duplex sold 3.238M  3. House sold 1.4M  3a. Duplex sold 2.28M, 2.38M   These listings go on forever. Unless youre one of the ones wealthy enough to do this, start looking for property past Penrith?

"CGT Question - 6 year rule
Ive asked this question to the tax advisors provided through my work but theyre all busy with EOFY. I have an investment property that Im looking to sell to pay down the mortgage on my PPOR. My calculation is that I can save around 500k on interest, and then use the equity in the PPOR and extra disposable income to invest elsewhere. My question is in regard to CGT and the 6 year rule. Situation Apartment purchased in 2011 at 515k - this was our PPOR. Home purchased in 2016 for 1.15 Mil - this became our PPOR and we rented out the apartment. Apartment is currently worth 950k Home is currently worth 1.80 Mil In 2016 we received a valuation from our Real estate agent saying the Apartment was worth 850k - my understanding is that is not sufficient for ATO purposes to claim that as the value when it stopped being our PPOR, so we would be looking to use the 6 year rule, looking at the value of the property in 2022. Just looking at past sales for the apartment block, 2022 sales are between 850-900k, and 2016 sales are 775k-850k, so were looking at about a 100k growth in that time. Meanwhile, in the same period our house would have gone up about 500k. What I dont understand is the other financial ramifications of this - if we use the 6 year rule does that mean were now up for CGT of our house for the capital gains from 2016-2022? 500k on the home vs 100k on the Apartment? If thats so were better off NOT using the 6 year rule and paying the CGT on the 100k. As a bonus question - howwhere do I get a historical valuation that the ATO will accept for CGT purposes?

This is an extract from the Money Cafe Podcast, that shows housing is going to continue to be unaffordable unless something drastic happens Alan Kohler I was at a discussion yesterday, which was Chatham House Rule where you couldnt report anything at the Australian Housing Supply and Affordability Council, which is headed by Susan Lloyd, who was former CEO of Mervinc. And there was a lot of discussion about what to do about it. And there was a panel discussion. If you really believed it was a crisis and one of the problems was planning, that theres not enough land being released and that local communities were preventing infill and densification of their suburbs, you would take it off them. You would simply nationalize planning and take it off councils. But nobodys going to do that. I said, and also the other thing is, I mean, do we need this many golf courses? Really? And parks and like, yeah, I mean, they were talking about how in order to achieve the sort of housing that is needed, even to meet the target of 1.2 million over 5 years that the housing accord has set, to meet that, they talked about needing 34 square kilometers of extra housing land released per year. Well, thats a lot of land. I mean, where are they going to get that from? This is just to meet the target. I mean, theyre nowhere near it. I mean, nobody really wants, because the other thing I said is that if we really are serious about housing becoming more affordable, then residential Real estate has to become a really bad investment for a long time. It has to not provide a return. So therefore, how can private capital do it?

"Does WAs social housing policy actually work?
I think the actual policies in place need to be discussed rather than just shouting into the void well duh we need more social housing, NIMBYs, all social housing is bad, etc. etc. To repeat what Ive said on recent posts I think the core issue here isnt opposition to social housing itself, but a lack of confidence in how its managed. The neighbors concerns about antisocial behavior and parking arent unique to East Perth, South Coogee, and Inglewood... theyre echoed in many communities where social housing is concentrated without adequate support systems. The governments Housing First policy makes sense in theory, but it relies heavily on mental health and support services that are already stretched thin in Perth, and it effectively makes the old 3-strike policy redundant. When we look at places like Inglewood we see that when you remove accountability like the old 3-strike rule without proper resources, things fall apart... and thats all people remember. The two recent purchases are at least mixed tenure 70 affordable, 30 social, not 100 social housing like Inglewood, but that doesnt magically erase community fears when the same flawed approach seems to be in play. Nor does it build trust in Minister Carey when, in November 2024, he himself said that large housing blocks like these just dont work. Minister Careys point about East Perth or South Coogee having lower social housing rates than other suburbs is fair, but density matters too. Dumping 236 units into one tower risks recreating the same problems weve seen elsewhere... unless they actually prove theyll manage it differently. If the government wants to ease NIMBY backlash, they need to stop acting like the problem is PR and start showing how this will work.

We received 2,434 public responses, which included 212 written submissions and 2,222 survey responses in response to the Exposure Draft and Regulatory Impact Statement published on the Engage Victoria site. As you may recall, following public consultation the Residential Tenancies and Residential Tenancies Rooming House Standards Amendment Minimum Energy Efficiency and Safety Standards Regulations 2024, the first tranche of reforms, came into effect on 1 December 2024. Further information can be found here. The second tranche of reforms, the Residential Tenancies Amendment Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards Regulations 2025 were made, introducing the following new standards and uplifts to existing standards to rental properties  a new cooling standard  a new draughtproofing standard  a new ceiling insulation standard  an uplift to the hot water system standard  an uplift to the heating standard  an uplift to the water efficiency rating for shower heads. A copy of the new regulations are available for download from Victorian legislation  legislation.vic.gov.au The three new standards and three uplifts to existing standards were both broadly supported during public consultation and addressed concerns around thermal comfort and energy efficiency in residential rental properties. In response to feedback contained in the submissions and surveys received, the new regulations include the following key changes from the Exposure Draft regulations  Standard for shower heads and hot water - the compliance date has been revised to provide further time to meet the standards.  Standard for hot water  The definition of what can be included in a calculation of unreasonable cost has been revised to include electrical work to upgrade a switchboard to accommodate additional load, to assist with the costs of compliance.  Standard for heating  An additional exemption has been included allowing rental providers to replace non-energy efficient heaters like for like if they are covered by a warranty. Further, the compliance date has been revised to provide further time to meet the standard.  Standard for cooling  The compliance date has been revised to provide additional time to meet the standard where there is no fixed cooling installed and a new rental agreement is entered into. The compliance date has also been revised to 1 July 2030 for all rental properties to meet the standard, regardless of whether a new rental agreement has commenced.  Standard for ceiling insulation - The compliance date has been extended to assist with the costs of compliance and support orderly industry capacity development. The standard now also includes a requirement that the insulation must be undertaken by a person that holds relevant qualifications as determined by the Minister for Energy and Resources.  Standard for draughtproofing  In addition to extending the compliance date, reference to unreasonable gaps or holes has been removed.  Exemption for community housing and specialised housing  Community housing and specialised housing program providers will be exempt from compliance with the energy efficiency standards and uplifts to the current standards. It is proposed that a review will be undertaken including completion of a dedicated RIS to determine retention of the exemption.

"Debt Recycling from Redraw Questions
Im fairly new to the concept of debt recycling in general. My situation is I currently have a house with about 50 equity, and an additional 150,000 in offset. Were looking to renovateextend at some stage in the next 2-4 years, so have focussed on building the offset, but were also about to have our first child so decided to start putting money into ETFs etc. to pay for high school e.g. public primary, private high school, so it gives us about a 12-13 year lead to build a decent fund for it. Im the bread winner, in the top tax bracket, pay div 293 etc. My wife is currently off work maternity leave but is a casual, about 60-70k a year. Weve set up a Vanguard account in her name and have been investing in ETFs, putting in 1000 a month, which comes out of my pay, gifted to a bank account in her name, and paid into Vanguard via that account. This has the benefit of reducing CGT exposure on capital gains. Ive been reading about debt recycling and now wondering whether we should instead be paying into the loan, redrawing from the loan directly into Vanguard account. My understanding is this would make the redrawn amount tax deductible, however given that account is in my wifes name, the question would be whether its deductible against my salary or hers I would assume hers in this scenario, as its as if she is taking out the loan for the investment. Would it make more sense to 1. Take money from my pay, transfer from offset to mortgage 2. Redraw from mortgage into an account in my name which is used to invest 3. Tax deduct the debt amounts should be easy to account - 1,000 a month, 12,000 a year, tax deduction at 45, tax deduction of 5400 per year 4. balance that against CGT discount 22.5 vs 15 tax on gains, or 7.5 tax difference Am I thinking of this right?

Hi all, I am after some advice on what to do with 160k in available equity from my principal place of residence PPOR. I am currently doing debt recycling on my PPOR loan redirecting repayments and contributions into investments via a split loan structure, so I am comfortable with some risk and long-term investment strategies. With this available equity, I am considering two main options 1. Use the equity as a deposit to purchase an investment property, leveraging into Real estate for potential capital growth and rental income. 2. Draw down the equity and invest in a diversified index fund portfolio, building a long-term share portfolio with the potential for dividends and franking credits. Here are some proscons I am weighing up  With stocks, I feel I could benefit from dividends and franking credits, and I like that I could sell portions over time to manage capital gains tax more efficiently.  With property, I could potentially benefit from negative gearing, especially in the early years. But I do see more potential risks  Property market fluctuations are less predictable.  Ongoing costs like maintenance and vacancies can eat into returns.  If I sell the property, its an all-or-nothing sale  meaning a large capital gain might hit all at once, with 50 CGT on the net gain after discount.  Property also ties up capital in a single asset, while shares allow for more diversification.

"How to avoid losing money during refinance?
Im about to refinance my mortgage to a new lender with a lower interest rate. However, last time I lost over 1k when I refinanced due to the time taken to transfer the large amount of cash from the old offset account to the new one Not only did I have a daily limit which required making multiple transactions - but each one of these were also pending for several days due to the large amount, further increasing the delay. The cherry on top was that the mortgage broker didnt even tell me about the settlement date when the previous mortgage closed and the new one became active, costing even more time and money.

Ive hold the IP for 6 years now and in this time, it had appreciated in value at least I hope so, wonbe sure until its sold.

"Milk Chocolate Property Review Unethical Business Practices - Avoid!
Failure to Complete Important Admin. Lying About Rental Law. Threatening and Bullying Tenants.  WARNING! Milk Chocolate Property Chippendale, NSW are an Atrocious Company! Do NOT allow them to manage your property, and do NOT rent a property managed by them. It is an absolute Clown Show. If you are a Rental Provider, Milk Chocolate Property will ruin your reputation and scare tenants away from your property. If you are a tenant, prepare for the worst! ISSUE 1 YOU PAY FOR PAPERWORK THEY DONT COMPLETE! Milk Chocolate Property rarely update documentation. When we lived in one of their rentals, they didnt add tenants approved by Rental Providers to the Bond or Lease documents. What are you paying them for, if not to perform these simple admin tasks? One agent harassed tenants over the phone, accusing them of hosting unauthorised persons at the property. Milk Chocolate Propertys OWN emails confirming tenants approval soon silenced this terrible outburst. Milk Chocolate Property often didnt reply to basic emails for over a month, including emails relating to urgent repairs such as mushrooms growing inside the rental. This reflects poorly on the Rental Providers, as tenants assume both the Rental Provider and agency have the same rate of reply, and should care about basic sanitation. In all, it seems Milk Chocolate Property take your money in exchange for services largely NOT rendered. ISSUE 2 THEY COST YOU RENT AND WASTE TENANT TIME - FOR NO REASON! Milk Chocolate Property will fail to advertise your property for 21 days of a paid 28-day notice period when tenants indicate their intention to leave, taking an additional month beyond the exit date to finally let your property. They will make tenants despise you by filing multiple spurious VCAT applications where they are the applicant, instead of the Rental Provider as is requested by VCAT, in vain attempts to recover this fee when they did not mitigate loss. The cases are ultimately dismissed and waste tenant time. In VCAT, the Member actually said direct quote To be honest, this is one of the messiest applications Ive ever seen, and its not fair on the respondents. ISSUE 3 THEY REFLECT POORLY ON YOUR REPUTATION BY CONSTANTLY LYING ABOUT RENTAL LAW, MAKING YOUR TENANTS DESPISE YOU! Milk Chocolate Property increased our rent by 100, and then by 55 per week on subsequent lease renewals without providing a Notice of Proposed Rent Increase. They refused to supply this even when directly asked via email, telling us we were not entitled to receive the document. The house was never completely vacated during our stay, and textemails from their agents, PLUS the Entry Condition Report and Bond lodgement dates confirm that each increase occurred during a renewal of the original lease. Not providing a Notice of Proposed Rent Increase is contrary to rental law s44, RTA 1997. It is also stealing from poor students. Their Officer in Effective Control OIEC sent us an email explaining how he doesnt believe his company should follow the law by providing this form, saying direct quote ...we believe that rental increases were agreed upon verbally and through continued occupancy under the revised terms. We have repeatedly asked for our overpaid rent to be refunded, and the OIEC responded with an email threatening to blacklist us despite our spotless tenant record, and reported one tenant to the Victorian Health Complaints Commissioner because he knows they are a medical student. This is arguably misuse of private vocational information and would reflect very badly upon the reputation of Rental Providers who entrust their rental properties to these unprincipled bullies - so dont! OTHER FISHY BEHAVIOUR Not inviting us to the Exit Condition Report Inspection. What if a tenant damaged your property? Wouldnt you like Milk Chocolate Property to obey rental law, inviting the tenant to verify findings in case of damage? By not inviting us, Milk Chocolate Property ceded claims to compensation for rental damage even though thankfully we didnt leave any. IN SUMMARY, DO NOT LEASE YOUR RENTAL OR RENT WITH MILK CHOCOLATE PROPERTY! IT IS CERTAINLY NOT WORTH IT AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY REGRET EVERYTHING. We were renting in VIC. Milk Chocolate Property are based in NSW, but operate in other states. This is not an exhaustive list of the issues encountered with Milk Chocolate Property.

"Advice on brokerslenders who accept OT and LAFHA as income.
My husband  I are looking at buying land or a property in the next 6 or so months,  are hoping to hear others experiences  recommendations in applying for a home loan when one of the borrowers income has a significant portion that is made up of OT  LAFHA. The OT  LAFHA are consistent, unless taking leave. His income has reflected this for all the years he has been working in this industry.

Ive been actively searching for about two months now, and Im still unsure whether I should stick to private sales only or start seriously attending auctions as well. My concerns mainly revolve around auctions being unconditional. From what Ive learned Id have to arrange a building and pest inspection before the auction. If I dont win the auction, that money is lost. If I win, and then the bank valuation comes lower than the purchase price, I may not be able to make up the shortfall from my own funds. I do have pre-approval in place and a 80K deposit, but the idea of getting caught in a financial or legal mess is a bit daunting. So Reddit community  is it worth giving auctions a shot, or should I stick with private sales for now? Would love to hear from others whove faced similar situations or bought in this area.

"How Much Should I Budget for a Full Renovation Before Selling My Principal Residence?
Im considering doing a full renovation on my principal residence before putting it on the market, and I have a few questions for those who have gone through this or work in the industry. Initially, I thought of just updating the kitchen and bathroom, but after evaluating the overall condition and style of the house, it feels like those updates alone wouldnt match the rest of the property. Ive seen some homes get fully renovated before theyre listed and sell for much more  so Im wondering if thats worth considering. My main questions 1. Budgeting How much should I realistically budget for a full renovation interior only and may be facade? Im in Sydney Ashfield area, my house is 4 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms and 2 car space. I know it depends on square footage, quality, etc., but any ballpark figures or per-square-foot estimates would help. 2. Who to consult Should I be looking to hire a general contractor, a renovation company, or an interior designerarchitect? What type of professionals are typically involved in this process? 3. Designplanning steps Do I need to create or approve a design plan first? Are there companies that handle both design and renovation as a package? Or should I consult separately with a designer and contractor? 4. Resale value vs. cost Any tips on how to make sure the renovation increases the resale value enough to justify the investment? Im trying to avoid over-renovating and not getting the return. Would love to hear from people whove done this or who are in the business. Any advice or resources would be appreciated!

"How to deal with this landlord who bullied me and took my bonds?
SEEKING TENANCY ADVICE - NSW I need advice regarding a serious issue with a landlord I found on Gumtree and Facebook, who has been taking advantage of vulnerable and naive tenants, myself included. I was heavily mistreated during a short term lease agreement with this landlord. We agreed to a 1 month minimum stay, with 2 weeks rent and 2 weeks bond upfront. I paid her a total of 1,500 directly into her personal bank account under the name, covering the bond and rent. She happily received them and sent a text confirmation on the receipt. After just five days, we spoke in person and I informed her that I needed to leave early due to an unexpected change in my work schedule. Instead of discussing it professionally and followed the laws and verbal contract she has made, she became dismissive and blamed it all my fault for choosing to leave earlier than expected. She told me I wouldnt get anything back, accused me of not understanding English and the tenancy rights here i Australia, and insisted the money didnt go to her bank and that she wasnt the owner and had no control over it. This directly contradicts the Facebook Gumtree ads where she listed herself as the owner and provided her own bank account for payments. So then I followed up to summarize what she said and confronted her in text message then came to her again to spoke in person and I firmly told her that this manipulative behaviour isnt right and it doesnt makes sense, she then guilt tripping me said that Im irrational and made her health worse then became verbally abusive to me for the rest of the day. She was aggressively rude in person towards but not so through text message since she knows I may report her. Despite my disagreement and confrontation, she still refused to return my 500 bond, claimed the utility fee was 50week despite the Facebook ad clearly stating 25week, and continuously changed information about weekly rents, utilities, bonds - told me that bonds is 1 month not 2 weeks as agreed and advertised on FB Gumtree. When I questioned her inconsistencies, she guilt-tripped me saying I was worsening her health and making her feel unsafe while aggressively monitoring my every move in the house. This toxic behavior pushed me to leave earlier than planned, on the afternoon of June 27, 2025, for the sake of my mental health. She also refused to let me use the washing machine to clean my work clothes before moving out, which was unnecessarily petty and disrespectful. Her treatment of me throughout was dishonest, manipulative, and emotionally abusive particularly toward young, international tenants who may not know their rental rights. I strongly believe this situation needs investigation. Her conduct raises serious red flags including false advertising, tax evasion, and emotional exploitation. I dont want others especially other young or international renters to go through what I did. I have reported her to FairTrading NSW, my Bank Account to request money back, ScamWatch. But is there anything else I can do?

"Housing crisis Victoria shows NSW and other states the way by taking power for housing approval away from local councils and concentrated it with the state planning minister
Ayear ago on Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese gave the nation five years to build 1.2 million homes, divided proportionately by population among all the states and territories. Victoria houses roughly a quarter of Australias population, and so is expected to build 306,000 homes by 2029. When it comes to meeting its share of new houses, on current trajectories and alone of all the states and territories, it will almost certainly get there. Cynicism pervades the assessment of Australian housing policy. Years of insufficient initiatives and deteriorating housing affordability lead most voters to assume that the latest announcement will fail. And yet, scepticism can obscure. In Canberra and across most states and territories, a shift in attitude is discernible. Out of favour is a focus on demand-side initiatives that give first home-buyers subsidies they then promptly pay to those who already own property. The new name of the game is supply. It isnt a futile goal. In one state, something has obviously been working. The Australian Bureau of Statistics considers a home as constructed once a water connection is active. On this relatively rigorous metric, Victoria is the nations home-building capital. It has built more homes than the relatively larger NSW every year since 2019. Adjusted for population, it has completed more than the smaller states, too. Using the December 2024 population statistics, Victorias latest quarterly figures equate to 2.2 homes completed per 1000 people, compared to 1.5 in Queensland, 1.6 in South Australia, 1.2 in Tasmania and 2.0 in Western Australia. The national average is 1.6 homes per 1000 people per quarter. Victoria is projected to hit 98 per cent of its national housing target, compared to 65 per cent for NSW. All other states except Tasmania and the Northern Territory are expected to do slightly better than NSW. If NSW cant lift its game, Australia will build 938,000 homes over the five-year period outlined by the federal government  just 78 per cent of the national goal. If NSW is dragging the average down, Victoria is raising it. It is building more homes, even though poor governance has consigned it to the status of a mendicant state, to cite economist Saul Eslake, and despite 47 per cent of its state budget being derived from property taxes. Victoria has built more despite a boom in government construction sucking workers away from home construction, despite a string of developer bankruptcies, and despite a militant CFMEU whose industrial success has lured workers away from poorer-paid residential construction work. To be blunt if so much is going wrong in Victoria, what could possibly be going right? Melbournes transformation from the bleak city of the 1980s and 1990s has been dramatic. Luis Enrique Ascui The roots of Melbournes modern-day building prowess were arguably laid decades ago. In the 1990s, the Kennett-era Postcode 3000 initiative aimed to have 3000 people living in the CBD, mostly in large-scale residential apartment towers. It was a phenomenal success, and central Melbourne is now home to over 30,000 residents. These city-dwellers are mostly international students, unattached young professionals, and, increasingly, cashed-up empty-nesters at the growing luxury end of the market. Critics of the scheme and its subsequent iterations point out that many of these city apartments are narrow shoeboxes housing students and poor new migrants. This may be the case for some, but it undersells the impact of that supply, says Grattan Institute economist and housing expert Brendan Coates. The alternative is those international students living four to a family home seven kilometres from the city, he says, which is what happens in most Australian cities. The Postcode 3000 initiative was also pivotal for house prices. Victoria is the big success story when it comes to affordability, Coates says. House prices have flat-lined there, while rising incredibly sharply across much of Australia. One of the reasons Melbourne dwelling prices have been flat is because of all those extra apartments  Theyve made housing much more affordable, and thats why house prices in Sydney and Melbourne parted ways some 15 years ago. The increasing density of the Melbourne CBD continued under ruling parties of both stripes, with new inner-city precincts like Docklands, Fishermens Bend and Arden adding thousands of homes into the market. Melbourne has built out the flat plains that surround it, too. In recent years, large planned communities have sprung up in almost every direction. In the months leading up to his September 2023 departure from office, former premier Daniel Andrews increasingly identified housing delivery as something on which Labor would be judged. Reforms begun then, and extended since, have helped unleash the current boom. Victoria Minister for Housing Sonya Kilkenny left with Labor member for Albert Park Nina Taylor. Penny Stephens Just how this works in Melbourne is evident on a late January day in the citys inner-north, where a small group of housing activists have turned up in force to a Merri-Bek City Council meeting. Their goal to provide noisy support to the latest development proposed by Nightingale Housing, a not-for-profit developer that wants to build 72 townhouses in Coburg North. This is the kind of building that should sail through. The councils paid planners like it. Its close to public transport. Several of the residences have been reserved for women fleeing domestic violence. Social service providers have turned up to offer their support. A single objection, and the misgivings of several councillors, have led to the public meeting. The councils reluctance, according to live updates posted by the YIMBYs, stems from the lack of parking. Adding it would increase the cost of the building, making it less affordable. It takes two hours for approval to be granted, once it becomes clear that any blocking of it would land the project in the Victorian Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Once there, Victorian Planning Minister Sonya Kilkenny will have the power to call it in  that is, use her powers of intervention to approve it directly. Resistance is futile. The plan passes. For the YIMBYs  members of a burgeoning pro-development movement populated by young people convinced supply is the only way theyll ever buy a house  its a successful nights work. This used to be a big part of what YIMBY Melbourne did. But according to local head Jonathan OBrien, such scenes are occurring less and less. The state government has just taken so much power away from councils, he says. There are just fewer of these fights to have. We dont spend a lot of time at council meetings these days. Victoria has expanded its development facilitation program, a form of deemed approval where projects worth over 50 million or 15 million outside metro Melbourne are now assessed by the government. Permits are now reliably issued within four months. There are no objection rights. If something is deemed to comply with a checklist, its approved. Councils take closer to a year. Such state government interventions are an increasingly common feature across all states. Victorias reforms are just a bit further along. The power for the minister to call in developments, for example, isnt new. But no planning minister recently has been as willing as Kilkenny to use it. The threat alone does wonders. This year alone, Kilkenny has called in 11 large-scale residential developments, adding to dozens personally approved in her three years in the role  like a plan to build 83 townhouses on what used to be the junior campus of Jesuit school Xavier College, to which 159 objections were filed, many over traffic concerns. The issue went to VCAT, and from there, to Kilkennys desk. The process to that point took two years. Speaking to AFR Weekend, Kilkenny said she was approached by the developers who requested she consider their proposal. She deemed it a really appropriate development for the area, 300 metres from Brighton Beach train station. I will do that, when necessary, she said. But ultimately, I want to work with councils and local governments. And I have to say, for the most part, they support the housing targets. Distant municipalities like Wyndham or Melton have grown 400 per cent in three decades, she says. Better-serviced inner-city councils like Boroondara or Bayside have barely grown 30 per cent over the same period. The burden on the outer suburbs, Kilkenny says, has been really disproportionate. And its meant young people and essential workers cannot live in the areas that have seen the greatest investment in public transport, schools and jobs. It is, she says, not fair, and bad for councils whose suburbs lose the vibrancy of young families and workers that they were once planned for. Thats not to say that everyone supports it. Kilkennys decisions are the regular subject of attacks from Liberals, local councillors and planning experts concerned about livability and how power is being taken away from councils. Residents in leafy and often Liberal-voting areas are furious, and stage snap protests when Labor ministers dare venture to their neck of the woods. On the other side, social housing advocates want more done. Ive worked on nationally awarded buildings, recognised as the gold standard in the country, says Dan McKenna. They wouldnt be approved under the current planning regs. McKenna is CEO of Housing All Australians, which aims to facilitate private developer investment in affordable housing. He used to lead not-for-profit developer Nightingale, whose quasi-communal townhouse developments in Melbournes inner-north are so popular that residents have to win a ballot to secure the right to purchase them off-the-plan. Play Video A group of residents outside the premiers press conference chanting shame, premier shame. He points out the irony of Australia being in a severe housing shortage while adding layers and layers and layers of regulation. There is, he says, a rigidity to the way things are assessed. Everything gets put in with the best intentions. But if you bake things in, projects get slowed down. At a certain point, they dont get up at all. Nonetheless, McKenna can discern a change in attitude, both in the state and federally. His impression is that the Victorian government is starting to untangle this. Breaking through such impasses is arguably easier for the Allan government than most. The controversial overriding of councils and the concentration of powers in the planning ministers office provokes backlash, but Victorias government is blessed with a hefty parliamentary majority and an opposition in disarray. Its a good time for that state to do unpopular things, muses Pru Goward, a former Liberal NSW planning minister. Its not as if theyre risking government. Planned and occasionally unpopular reforms in Victoria include the loosening of controls around deemed activity centres  well-connected zones near train or tram transport. Meanwhile, the aforementioned Development Facilitation Program and its deemed approval method is a boon for larger developments, which are now far harder to bog down in appeals and litigation. The most anticipated reform is the Townhouse Code, which started three months ago. Modelled on Aucklands density-and-affordability-boosting housing reforms, its described by Coates and others as one of the most ambitious such ideas in the country. It extends deemed approvals to townhouses of up to three storeys, and neighbours and councils are unable to object if a development meets set standards. Townhouses are an excellent entry home for many Victorians who want to get a foot in the market while living close to the city and being well-served by public transport, Kilkenny says. The key, though, she says, is diversity a state that doesnt just facilitate one type of housing but that enables people to respond to shifting housing needs. To achieve this, the planning system has and needs to continue shifting. Our planning system is the reason we are finding ourselves in this position now, Kilkenny says. For too long, its been a planning system that has said no to homes. Developer Tim Gurner The strong consensus in other states is that Victoria is broke, its cold, and your property prices dont go up. Eamon Gallagher Youd think, given all this, that developers would love Victoria. Youd be wrong. Most echo luxury builder Tim Gurner, who said the strong consensus in other states is that Victoria is broke, its cold, and your property prices dont go up. Commercial property syndicator Shane Quinn told an Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce lunch in May that international property investors he met had a saying for putting money in Australia, which was ABV Anywhere But Victoria. In May, after a state budget where property taxes accounted for 47 per cent of the states revenues, the Property Councils Cath Evans wrote that her research shows punitive taxes had caused Victoria to miss out on an estimated 81,000 homes in a decade. Some recent ABS figures  like dwellings under construction and planning approvals  do suggest a slowing Victorian home construction sector, albeit from a high base. McKenna describes the situation for developers as death by a thousand cuts. Cost escalations have been really significant. There have been planning delays. The cost of financing has been more challenging. And also, on the purchaser side, higher interest rates make it harder for people to borrow, so developers have found it harder to secure pre-sales. Nerida Conisbee, the chief economist for real estate agency Ray White, says Victoria has so much going for it. But, if you talk to those in the development community, its so discouraging for anyone not building on the urban fringe. She points to the role of taxes. Victoria secures 47 per cent of its state budget through taxes on property, compared to 44 per cent in NSW and 37 per cent in Queensland. Grattans Coates is willing to defend the tax take. Property imposts, he says, are not all created equal, and he says Victorias are some of the best. Most of the new ones, like the emergency services levy, are land taxes, charged yearly on a proportion of land value. It reduces what the developer will pay for the land. It reduces the prices on the property. It isnt economically destructive in the way stamp duty is. Land tax is one of the best taxes we have. Coates argues that its difficult to sustain the argument that Victoria is unique in levying such taxes, and says it does so only slightly more than others. The exception to that, he says, might be its foreign investor levies, which are higher than those elsewhere in the country. The Property Councils national chief Mike Zorbas says theres no doubt Victoria has advantages not least in its topography. But, he says, imagine how much better things could be if the state welcomed in overseas capital from Canadian, Dutch or South-East Asian pension funds. These people want to build large-scale housing in Australia. Theres a growing population. Its a stable democracy. Its rich. But every time a tax is tweaked  and there are 18 property taxes in Victoria  they have to report back to their funders, whether its a domestic bank or a private syndicate. What our members are saying is that most of South-East Asia is now very unlikely to fund domestic property in Victoria. Theyre starting to look at Queensland for the first time. No business person ever lost by complaining about being over-taxed. At worst, one doing so is ignored. At best, it encourages the opposition to take up ones cause, and lower taxes and higher profit margins are the reward for ones bleating. Some pointy heads dismiss developer gloom by pointing out it is de rigueur to be down on the Victorian government, and the broader economy. Legendary developer Max Beck alluded to such attitudes at the same lunch that Quinn spoke at last month. Its all bullshit, he told the audience, chiding them for spending too much time reading News Corp publications he believes aim to oust the government. Every state had land taxes, he expanded, and it wasnt a bad thing housing was cheaper in Melbourne than in Sydney. Weve got so many pluses  well be fine. Apartment towers including the infamous Opal Tower overlook Bicentennial Park at Sydney Olympic Park. Janie Barrett Its Sydney where the war for the future of housing is being fought. And most people agree its those who dont own property who are losing. NSW planning officials are allergic to the very concept of a rigorous cost benefit analysis or regulatory impact assessment, claims a report from developers lobby Urban Taskforce in April. It is NSW, the report states, that has seen the worst of the boom in planning controls, fees, taxes and charges, state-based building regulations, design competitions and design review processes. Clover Moore and her council call Sydney the city of villages. How pathetic is that for Australias leading city?  Pru Goward, former NSW planning minister Former NSW planning minister Pru Goward is sympathetic to such views. She has written of receiving the portfolio and suddenly becoming the most popular member of cabinet. Apart from the member for Parramatta, who always wanted more infrastructure, most members wanted me to stop something. Asked why Sydney doesnt build more homes, Goward cites the high cost of building around hills and waterways. But also, she says, its the attitude, which gave her no end of grief during her time as planning minister. One failure still clearly rankles Goward tried and ultimately failed to push through a major mixed-use development at Waterloo. The proposal was fiercely opposed by Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, who wanted it to include a high social housing percentage, which Goward says meant the project no longer stacked up financially. Clover Moore and her council call Sydney the city of villages, Goward says. How pathetic is that for Australias leading city? Theyve fought tooth and nail against densification. And every resident in the world wants to be the last person to move in. Tom Forrest, of the Urban Taskforce, has spent more time pondering the variances of housing construction across states than most. A former chief of staff to ex-NSW premier Morris Iemma, his members now are some of the nations largest commercial developers, like Multiplex, Stockland, Meriton and Walker Corporation. If Sydney has a wariness of development, history may explain why. Forrest reflects the scandal of NSWs last form of deemed approval for major developments, which was abolished by the incoming Liberal government after it won the 2011 election. Every time the minister signed something off, Kate McClymont would get out her spreadsheet and look at donations to the Labor Party, says Forrest of the award-winning Sydney Morning Herald journalist, who uncovered the Eddie Obeid corruption scandal. Property developers were banned from political donations in NSW in 2007. Victoria still allows property donations at a state and local level, but the former bans anyone from donating more than 4850 over four years, limiting the reliance on any single donor. Sydneys experience with large-scale developments  apartment towers, principally  is no better. In 2019, a large crack appeared in the wall of the then-decade-old Mascot Towers. The developer went into liquidation, and the NSW government ended up making assistance payments of 24.5 million to residents, owners and investors. A year earlier, the 37-storey Opal Tower at Sydneys Olympic Park was also evacuated, though remedial works were conducted and residents have since moved back in. Such episodes continue to reverberate. Few apartment-buyers in Sydney can fail to consider the history, even though, Forrest argues, the bodgie developers have left the industry, while those remaining are burdened with greater regulation. Forrest argues Australia needs to get over developer bashing, and view such companies as its partners in housing delivery. Development isnt easy. ASIC data shows our sector is massively overrepresented in terms of liquidations and bankruptcies, he says. No one makes much money, and many go broke. Forrest also cites figures showing 96 per cent of new dwellings are delivered by the for-profit developer community, with only 4 per cent deriving from community housing initiatives. If the dogs dying, putting a band-aid on its tail wont help. We represent the dog, not the tail. Resistance to home-building in Sydney still makes headlines. In May, the Minns Labor government failed in a plan to buy the Rosehill Racecourse, after members of the Australian Turf Club voted down a plan that would have netted them 5 billion in return for the land, which the government hoped could accommodate 25,000 homes. Still, there are green shoots. NSW is instituting a range of planning reforms, of variable ambition. The in-fill affordable housing policy, which funds social housing by letting the developer keep the title while the house is rented out in effect subsidising the discount through the accrual of capital gains, is going well. And few can fail to be heartened by the stunning early vigour of the Housing Building Authority. Launched only in January, this is another deemed approval framework, whereby three highly regarded public servants Forrest calls them the holy troika have been empowered to recommend that the planning minister approve developments valued greater than 60 million the expectation is the minister will approve the vast majority, if not all. In five months, the authority has already considered 130 developments, which would provide another 55,000 individual dwellings. This is more homes approved for construction by the Housing Building Authority in five months than were completed by NSW in all of 2024, when just 45,000 homes were built. Some projects may not eventuate or pass ministerial approval. But the hope is that the overwhelming majority will. More projects are considered every two weeks. Sydney could be building a lot of homes very soon. The new focus on building is a relief to Peter Tulip, chief economist at the Centre of Independent Studies. The housing specialist, formerly of the Reserve Banks research department, has issued report after report calling out unfair zoning rules. He welcomes the federal governments housing targets, which match the last peak of housing construction from a few years before the pandemic. Essentially, weve built at these levels before, he says of the 240,000-a-year figure. Its clearly feasible in two senses. First, economically, in that we can run a construction industry at these levels, but also politically, in that the community has previously accepted these levels of construction. In the long run, hed like to see more ambition. He suspects the public do too. The political discussion is unrecognisable now in Australia from what it was a few years ago, he says. If you remember the Bill Shorten elections in 2016 and 2019, the discussion was all about taxes  Now, as the prime minister says, its all supply, supply, supply. And you see that in opinion polls. More people support more housing in every poll. Such polls show that most Australians believe housing affordability is a key concern, but they dont applaud the solutions of both major parties to the problem. Tulip reads this as an invitation to bold action. This shortage of homes has developed over decades, he says. Itll take a while to fix. This is a high level of construction, but itll need to be maintained and increased going forward to solve the affordability crisis. Asked what Australia could learn from Victoria, Kilkenny says that focus is the thing. I think its terrific were having this conversation, she says, and gives credit to Federal Housing Minister Clare ONeil for putting the emphasis on planning reform. Goward also points to the role of the federal government. Her own experience has her questioning whether even resting approvals with state governments is enough. The further away from the decision the planning authorisation is, the better. For the Property Councils Zorbas, the good thing about the targets is they make progress visible, and allow state-by-state comparisons. And because of the focus, he says, I think well come close. Closer than a lot of people think. And some states will clearly make it. Zorbas wants the targets to roll over in 2029. Weve had two generations of politicians squibbing it on housing supply, he says. We dont need this for five years  we need it for 50. We can never again afford to have 20 or 30 years go past saying its all too hard.",96,0.92,70,housing,Australian Housing Dynamics and Policy Developments,Negative,2,6/28/2025 16:59,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1lmght0/housing_crisis_victoria_shows_nsw_and_other/,AustralianPolitics

Strata is approx 1k pq, and the capital works fund is currently around 47k. There are also some other things Im concerned about such as  No Fire Safety CertificateAFSS, it was voted to get one but it wasnt sited in report.  No defect report, voted against.  No asbestos report, voted against.  A few years running of no money spent on cleaning gutters or pest control.  16k per year on cleaning and gardening. Feels like a lot but not sure.  There is a 10 year capital works plan but a majority of this is just for painting.

"Building inspection in Sutherland Shire
Im looking for a building inspection for my property and want some advice on selecting a reputable company that can do a fair and concise inspection. We have a bunch of cracks across our house. These existed when we purchased and the report at the time identified no major concerns. But, the previous owner is a developer and built this property. The report was purchased by them by a vendor they chose. There might be nothing in that but I wonder if there is some relationship between them meaning the report had some integrity concerns. So, Im keen to avoid dodgy companies that will cut corners but also not going to scam me into significant repairs that might just be cracks that can be remediated more simply. If we do need serious repair, so be it. Anyone got any experience in this area or can recommend someone in my area?

Hi everyone! Up until recently, my family and I, who all live in Australia, have owned an apartment in Belarus long story that we have been renting out to others for many years. We recently sold this property, and have paid the tax for the selling of the property. All has been done legally and with full documentation to show ownership and bills paid. However, we want to transfer the money from the Belarus bank account to an australian bank account, but the bank in belarus that we use technobank has informed us that they cannot transfer the money to an overseas account due to sanctions or something like that war in Russia affecting things like banking in Belarus as well with the rest of the world I believe, and when asked for an alternative, they said to transfer the money physically, which has its own set of problems I want to avoid entirely, and I would consider a dangerous choice. Is there another method of accomplishing this task whilst avoiding difficulties like sanctions interfering with monetary transfers between international accounts?

"The subtle art of paint match and blending - any artisans in Melbourne?
Id like to clear up a few small marks on a couple of walls in my house, as Im looking to sell. The REA sent his tradies through and spat out a quote of over 10k just for painting approx 9 interior walls, and a couple of areas of weatherboard. There are 4 very small walls that do require a full repaint. But there are many more with just a couple of small scratches and he wants to repaint the entire wall. This involves prep, covering everything in the room, and he was grossly overcharging - he even quoted the ceilings which were installed brand new a year ago and look absolutely perfect. Total rip-off. Yet Ive worked with a guy back in Sydney who was a patch and match master. He could take a 100mm hole in the plaster, and sand it back to perfection. Hed plaster it and sand it back so it was the perfect height and texture of the surrounding walls. Then hed buy the same paint as the original I have a full paint chart for every wall in my house, all made by Haynes, with product codes and manage to paint the plaster, slightly change the colour if required to match the original coat he may add a bit of white, or yellow, or grey, to slightly lighten it then do incredible blending and feathering of the edges of the new paint. It was incredible- the end result was one wall that started with two holes in it, that ended up looking brand new. You could not pick out the new paint, even if you looked for it from any angle. He charged around 150 per holescratch, which would take him two to three hours to do each one. This was in 2018, so I expect he probably charges more now. It actually used to be a fairly common skill and was called paint blending, yet todays painters tend to only do full walls. Does anyone know of skilled painters who offer this service in Melbourne? Im in the inner city, and have about twelve to spots that need doing, plus four full but small walls that need to be totally done. Im then thinking a thin coat of satin across everything to make it look even better. As Im selling, it really needs to be top notch work. My scratches and marks are tiny and painting the entire wall for a couple of tiny scratches seems very wasteful and means heaps of paint protection must be used. Its also way more time consuming, and leaves the house with the horrible smell of new paint. Please shoot me a PM or post in the thread if you know any painters who can still feather small scratches to match the existing paint work, the original paint is about five years old.

"Post contract variation
I bought a house and land package in NSW in April 2025, and the DA was just approved in early June 2025. I was really excited to see the build start soon  but now Ive received a Post Contract Variation with a fairly significant added cost screenshot attached. The variation includes things like double glazing and insulation upgrades for BASIXNatHERS compliance, supposedly to meet the requirements of the updated NCC 2022 energy efficiency standards. Whats confusing is These NCC 2022 rules came into effect in NSW from 1 October 2023, so by the time I signed in April 2025, I assumed these compliance costs would have already been built into the original contract price. Is it normal for builders to add these as a variation only after DA approval? Or should I be questioning why this wasnt accounted for earlier? I tried to reach out to the agent, the answer I got was your house is at the corner at the very end, it could be receiving more sunlight., but there are about 20 corner houses, how is that possible they didnt take that in to account Tbh, its not a lot of money, but really annoying. Me and my family Cant help to start thinking what if they keep bring up different rules to ask for money later. Would really appreciate any advice or similar experiences. Thanks!

Hi everyone, Id love to hear your thoughts or experiences with Meriton, especially their developments in Epping. Ive been renting in one of their Sydney CBD units for quite a while and never had any major issues. However, this time Im considering buying off-the-plan for investment purposes, and things feel a bit different. From what Ive seen, most of the released units are already sold, and the building itself is already constructed. So far, so good  but Im a bit concerned about the contract terms. For example  Theres a 4-year lock-in period if I want to use their guaranteed rental scheme before settlement.  They allow up to 10 changes in common areas.  Theres a clause that basically requires you to vote in their favour for building matters. Im wondering  are these kinds of terms normal for off-the-plan purchases? Is there usually room to negotiate, or is it more of a take it or leave it situation? Also, since this would be my first off-the-plan investment, are there any red flags or key things I should be aware of? My plan is to rent it out initially, but I might move in myself in 23 years though I dont even know when the final settlement will happen yet, despite the building being physically on their way.

"Unit work done without any formal approval from the body corporate
Hey everyone, Were seriously considering buying a unit in NSW Northern Beaches and have a walkthrough booked tomorrow to inspect it. The agent disclosed that several renovations were done without formal strata approval  Bathroom was renovated around 2 years ago  Flooring was replaced a couple of years ago  Kitchen was renovated this year The vendor says the Building passed its fire audit after all of this work was completed, which gives us some confidence. But were not builders, so while well check it out, we wont be able to verify structural or waterproofing issues ourselves. What worries us is Clause 43 in the contract, which basically waives our right to complain, delay settlement, or claim compensation later  even if these unapproved works become a problem. Were wondering  Is this kind of situation common in older strata units?  Should we be pushing for retrospective strata approval before purchase?  Is it a major red flag worth walking away from? Heres the full Clause 43 for context 43. The vendor discloses to the purchaser that the vendor has carried out works to the property. The vendor believes, to the best of her knowledge, that the works have been carried out at the property without any formal approval from the body corporate. The purchaser acknowledges that they are aware of the existence of the works and that the body corporate has not formally approved them. The purchaser agrees that they cannot make any objection, delay settlement, raise a requisition or claim for compensation nor have any right of rescission or termination by reason only of the facts disclosed in this special condition.

In Sydney. What if you buy a property as an IP, but you have to live in it as your PPOR for the first 6 months or better still 12 months, to be safe. In regards to quantum of loan and interest rates. Because the banks will lend a greater quantum and charge a higher interest rate for IPs. When shopping for a loan, would you ask about interest rates for IPs and PPORs at the same time. And pick the bank that is the best compromise between both of the rates. So when you get the loan, you move in, then you inform the bank you are using it as a PPOR, and get the lower interest rate first. Then when you change the property to an IP, the interest rate increases. Otherwise you will have to refinance your loan when changing from a PPOR to an IP.

"QLD sunset clause reform for off the plan puchases
There is growing concern among Queensland buyers particularly in rapidly growing regions regarding the misuse of these clauses by property developers. Specifically, a number of developers are engaging in the deliberate delay of construction in order to invoke sunset clause provisions, terminate legally binding contracts and relist the properties at significantly higher market prices. This practice is not only unjust, but it is causing significant financial and emotional hardship to the original purchasers who entered contracts in good faith. I, along with several other affected purchasers, recently appeared in a Channel 9 News segment where we highlighted the developers misconduct and the devastating impact this has had on buyers. The community response to this issue has been overwhelmingly supportive with the segment having over 60,000 views and many have expressed a strong desire to see the law strengthened to protect consumers from such exploitative behaviour. I have included a link to the segment posted of Channel 9s Facebook page below.

"Victorian governments fast-tracked apartments breach own liveability rules
PAYWALL Apartments falling short of minimum space requirements have been green-lit and fast-tracked by the Victorian government, as the state faces intense pressure to meet ambitious housing targets. The revelation comes as documents show Homes Victoria, the government agency responsible for social and affordable housing, is prioritising lowering costs on its public housing towers redevelopment project. The agency also flagged the possibility of cutting costs by changing the specifications of its low- and medium-density housing designs, raising concerns about potential low-quality designs. Planning documents reveal a 55 million Greensborough building being developed by a private firm was exempted from providing bedrooms and living areas that meet minimum sizes for some apartments. The standards, known as the Better Apartment Design Standards, were introduced in 2017 and updated in 2021 to improve liveability. The government promised to end cramped dog boxes after a boom in apartment construction. The 17-storey Greensborough tower was approved last month by Planning Minister Sonya Kilkenny under the governments Development Facilitation Program, a scheme that allows the state to bypass council approval and community consultation for projects making significant economic contributions or including affordable housing. David Hayward, emeritus professor of public policy and the social economy at RMIT University, said the governments decision to bypass democratic processes for a development that contravenes its own standards was troubling. He said the government might have been motivated to approve the project because it had so far failed to meet its Housing Statement target of 80,000 homes a year. Last year, it was 20,000 short. Missing targets by such a margin puts great pressure to approve high-density developments, even if they are of questionable quality, Hayward said. The Greensborough tower, developed by Greensborough Central Investments, will feature more than 200 one- and two-bedroom apartments, to be rented out below market rates. Together Housing, a newly registered community housing provider, secured federal government funding through Housing Australia to deliver the community housing at the site. Planning documents reveal Kilkenny approved the project despite its variation from the states apartment design standards, which mandate minimum sizes for bedrooms and living rooms. The development also falls short on stipulated total storage requirements for some apartments. Despite the non-compliance, the governments assessment of the Greensborough project said the units were generously sized and provided a high level of internal amenity, and therefore met the guidelines objectives. It did not reveal how many of the 200 apartments had bedrooms and living rooms smaller than standard, or give further information on why the deviation was deemed acceptable. The apartment design guidelines allow developers to propose alternative solutions, which the government then assesses against the guidelines objectives. A government spokesperson said up to a quarter of the homes would be social housing, with the remainder affordable housing for 25 years. The apartments ranged from 50.5 square metres to 76.3 square metres, and met minimum internal storage volume requirements, the spokesperson said. They did not directly address a question asking why the government approved the project despite it not meeting minimum room sizes. Tetris, a company that invests in and helps deliver social and affordable housing and has links to the Greensborough project, said it looked forward to the homes becoming available for people in urgent need of such housing. But Greensborough resident and Real estate agent Wayne Hutchinson said the development had locals blood pressure boiling, and he feared the suburb would be stuck with low-quality housing. It will be visible from just about every part of Greensborough and change it forever, he said. The community was not consulted in any way and only found out about it after it was approved. No one denies that we need more appropriate housing, but make sure its done appropriately. It should not be done in stealth. YIMBY Yes In My Backyard lead organiser Jonathan OBrien said it was reasonable to deviate from the standards for homes in a suitable location where people wanted to live. We know that construction costs are super-high at the moment, and we know that we want to deliver affordable housing. Australia builds some of the biggest apartments and houses in the world  if we want more affordable options, we might need to deliver less expensive apartments that people can choose to live in, he said. The best outcome is that people have homes, and if the homes are slightly smaller than a set of standards made for brand-new market housing then I think thats a fair trade-off. Separately, documents obtained through freedom-of-information laws by the state opposition raise fresh concerns about the governments plans to redevelop 44 public housing towers, a process that has already seen demolition begin at Carltons Elgin Street and relocations under way in North Melbourne, Flemington, South Yarra and Richmond. Meeting minutes from Homes Victoria last year show the board noted the complexity of the redevelopment project, which it said needed a tailored approach for each site, but noted lowering the unit price was a priority. The documents also show the government is looking at ways it can alter the specifications of Homes Victorias new low- and medium-density units to make them cheaper. Emeritus Professor Hayward said he was increasingly concerned that the governments primary focus was its growth objectives for social and affordable housing, with tenant wellbeing and quality design taking a backseat. Liberal MP David Davis accused the Allan government of planning its social housing projects on the cheap, slashing quality and looking at yield beyond the long-term viability. People expect more, Victorians expect more from their government than cheap, nasty shoddy builds, he said. A spokesperson for Housing Minister Harriet Shing said all homes delivered by the state government would meet or exceed minimum design standards, including bedroom and living sizes. When the Liberals arent blocking the delivery of new homes for Victorians who deserve the same opportunity of home ownership that their parents had, they are cutting corners and dudding consumers, the spokesperson said.",30,0.89,40,housing,Australian Housing Dynamics and Policy Developments,Negative,2,6/17/2025 14:17,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1lddxfo/victorian_governments_fasttracked_apartments/,AustralianPolitics

"Reimagining How Property Is Discovered, Valued, and Sold 
Hey Everyone Im working on something big  Premarket, a new social platform that flips the script on the property game. Im calling on investors, agents, buyers, and sellers to help validate or critique the concept.  My Mission Right now, agents are paying THOUSANDS  per campaign to REA and Domain just to get seen. Buyers are only shown whats on-market. And homeowners are flying blind until they go all in and sell. I figure thats a bit broken - My Premarket app changes that. I have built a social network for Real estate  where every property can be listed for free, buyers can explore dream properties before theyre even for sale, and agents get a new flow of leads and exposure without being taxed by media giants.  How it works 1. Homeowners can list their homes and get popularity data  even if theyre just curious. 2. Buyers can like, comment, save dreamboards, or request to make an offer  even if the homes not on the market. 3. Agents can hired at any stage by the home owner and cab step in only when needed to manage inspections, negotiations, and due diligence. Agents can set prices within the app. 4. Everyone gets data Popularity scores, trends, engagement signals  insight before action. This is not another listing portal. This is a pre-market social layer where value flows back to the people on the ground, not the digital landlords.  Why Agents Are Getting Around It  List unlimited stock  for free.  Showcase your packages and fees upfront.  Get hot buyerseller leads with real intent.  Facilitate off-market deals that would never have existed.  No more open homes or fewer  No more wasted weekends  Why Buyers Love It  Discover properties that arent on market  yet.  Make early offers.  Pin homes to your Dreamboard, and well notify you if they show movement.  Why Sellers Win  Get real-time popularity scores from real people.  Decide if going to market is worth it  or just do a deal now.  Feel that dopamine hit when your homes getting saves, shares, dreamboard pins.  All without pressure. No campaign cost. Just insight.  The Movement This is a shift in mindset. Its not about replacing agents  its about freeing them. Its about giving homeowners leverage. Its about giving buyers more opportunity, not just whats leftover. And its about cutting the cord from media monopolies bleeding the industry dry. If youre an agent, investor, buyer or seller  Id love your thoughts. Rip it apart, challenge the model, or tell me what would make you use it. Drop your opinions, roast me, or DM if you want early access or to collaborate.

My sister and I moved into an apartment 5 weeks ago on a fixed 12 month lease. On our second day here we noticed the only bathroom on the property was leaking when somebody showered directly to the tenants property below. We reported this and were given advice not to use the shower until repairs were made and were given a rent reduction of 100. The water damage was impacting power as well because each time wed turn the bathroom light on itd trip the system and cause the TV or work monitors to flicker. Somebody had come and quoted the repair a week after we reported this  then a second quote was done on Thursday about 2 weeks after that totalling no use of shower for 4ish weeks. The tradesman advised there was major damage that had been there for a long time. Due to the severity of the repair required  for our safety, the PM contacted us on Thursday  provided us a notice to leave immediately. They just kept apologising but didnt offer any compensation for the need to move. We are still here atm because we moved out of home due to extenuating circumstances and have no where to live unless couch surfing at friendsother family and have so many items needed to move.

"Seeking Advice End of tenancy landlord and unapproved work after bond release
Hey Reddit, Im hoping to get some perspective on a tricky situation with my former tenants. I own a property that I initially rented out privately to a friend. We had an agreement that hed keep track of any damages to avoid issues at the end of the tenancy. Fast forward, I decided to sell the house. During the tenancy, his girlfriend moved in as an approved applicant, and their bonds were combined at their request. When they moved out, I tried to be accommodating and fast-tracked the bond release so it wouldnt impact their rental history. My intention was to sort out any damages privately outside of the bond process. Now, things have taken an unexpected turn. The ex-tenants are trying to get me to pay them 550 for some work they did on the property that was completely unapproved as in, they never even brought it up until now and I didnt know it was even done. So, trying to be fair, I told them Id take the paint and patch jobs a couple hundred dollars out of the bill and give them the rest. But now the girlfriend is claiming they shouldnt have to pay for any damages because it should have been taken out of their bond and asking for the bill to be paid in full. no response from my friend - radio silence. While I appreciate their efforts to help with the property, this feels really inappropriate. The tenancy is officially over, and theyve moved out. Im already planning to fix the damages as part of the preparations for selling the house and considering just blocking their contacts and moving on. I feel a bit conflicted, I wanted to end things on a positive note but it seems like theyre handling this in a really strange and roundabout way.

"Buying our first home - advice appreciate
Hi, my partner and I are currently looking at buying our first home in South East Melbourne. We make roughly 200k total income. and have a good size deposit 20. We are aiming to buy a 3 bed, 1-2 bath on a 500-600m²  block, for 750-840k. We have been looking in an area that I think we are being priced out of. My question to you guys is what do we do 1. Buy same size but on a smaller block i.e. unit or townhouse, whilst paying 750-840k for it. 2. Find a different suburb with the same criteria. This would mean longer travel for work. 3. Put down a smaller e.g. 10-20 deposit and buy a more expensive home e.g. 850-900k. which could be our forever home.

"Bought my first property and sleepless
I just bought a house at cragieburn for 785k yesterday. It was at auction, i felt like i went too high but i had the approval so i couldnt stop. Because of a family member help, I have options to go for 0 percent deposit or 5 percent deposit or 10 percent deposit.  Lmi waiver I can go either go interest only or Principal  interest.  0,5,10 percent deposit. I am single and i make around 105k a year. I can either keep it as an investment property or i can start living in it  subletting 2 rooms - pays around 650-700 a month. If i put whole property on rent, Rental income would be around 580-585 a week. Currently, i live in a sharing accomodation at around 1000 a month. I understand about CGT ,negative gearing but i wish to know what would be my best deposit option to go for to build wealth. Ultimate goal is FIRE and to have passive income from etfsproperties. Currently i have around 138k in savings bank account and 75k in etfs. Stamp duty to be paid amongst these. If i go for lesser deposit, most likely i will keep on investing in etfs. I have less knowledge of properties but i was wondering if someone can tell me a good idea at my stage to buy next property soon or to achieve FIRE. Kindly guide.

"Advice please
My father passed away and left the family home of over 70 years in a trust to my brother and I plus our Step Mother. Our Step Mother is allowed to stay in the property until she chooses not to when the property will be sold and divided in thirds. My Step Mother and I are both on the Title of the house. My Step Mother is responsible for maintaining the property. There is vacant land next door and I was contacted this week by the owner to let me know that they would commence building works in next few weeks and the fence would need to come down. New development will form part of fence line and the rest new fence. I am all for this as the current is the original 70 yo fence and is in pretty bad shape. I verbally agreed that this was all ok and that we would go halves on the new fence. Developer has asked me to sign a document next week that basically agrees to fence and also we will be covered for an any damage to our property during the building process. Developer is a reasonable person and the new fence will only enhance our rapidly decaying house. Since my Dad died my Step Mother has moved her daughter into the house. Daughter is a very unpleasant person, a hoarder and a back yard dog breeder. Other members of step mothers family are concerned about Elder Abuse but this is out of my hands as I am not a relative. This has been told to me in no uncertain terms. I contacted my Step Mother about the fence and building works and received no response from her. I did receive a response from the daughter who told me that they would be declining the new fence and would not allow works to happen. She was adamant that she will be causing issues over this. Can they refuse to have the fence replaced? Or refuse to have the builders work on the boundary? Do I have rights as the 50 owner on the Title Deed.

"As boomers pass away, a larger volume of housing stock is expected to return to the market than immigration could make up for - a quantitative analysis. This mortality trend is not evenly distributed over timeit begins slowly in the 2020s, accelerates through the 2030s and 2040s
This mortality trend is not evenly distributed over timeit begins slowly in the 2020s, accelerates through the 2030s and 2040s, and tapers off by the 2050s. .... Australias baby boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is unusually large because of the postSecond World War demographic and economic expansion. After the war ended in 1945, a combination of strong economic growth, the return of servicemen, and supportive government policies such as family allowances and easier access to housing led to a sustained rise in birth rates. This baby boom lasted for nearly two decades and produced a generation significantly larger than those that came before or after. As of 2024, baby boomers account for around 5.5 million people, or approximately 20.5 per cent of Australias population of 26.8 million. In contrast, most generational cohorts usually represent only 12 to 14 per cent of the population, making the baby boomers 50 to 70 per cent larger than neighbouring generations such as Generation X. This unusually large generation holds a dominant position in the Australian housing market. Baby boomers entered adulthood during a period of expanding suburbs, accessible credit, and relatively affordable property prices. Over the years, they accumulated significant housing wealth, both as owner-occupiers and as investors, particularly benefiting from the long rise in house prices that began in the 1980s. By 2023, Australians aged between 55 and 74, which covers most of the baby boomer generation, owned nearly half of all residential housing wealth in the country. This presents a considerable structural shift. As baby boomers age, downsize or pass away, a substantial portion of housing stock is expected to become available on the market. According to life expectancy data, approximately 90 per cent of baby boomers will pass away between 2025 and 2060. Assuming an average of two people per household, this would result in around 3 to 3.5 million dwellings becoming available. This large transfer of housing, whether through deceased estates or downsizing, represents a significant potential increase in housing supply. Without sufficient new demand to absorb these properties, particularly in outer suburban and regional areas, house prices may stagnate or even fall over the longer term. Maintaining steady population growth will be essential to prevent a supply surplus from leading to a fall in property prices. Net overseas migration has long been central to Australias population and housing demand. From 2010 to 2019, net migration typically ranged between 180,000 and 250,000 people per year. During the COVID-19 pandemic, net migration dropped to near zero due to international border closures. It rebounded sharply after the pandemic, reaching a record 500,000 people in 2022 to 2023, before easing to around 395,000 in 2024, according to government estimates. To absorb the expected 3 million dwellings made available through baby boomer mortality, Australia would need to add around 7.5 million people over 30 years. This equates to approximately 250,000 net migrants per year on average. This is the minimum level required simply to offset the impact of boomer-related housing turnover. In practice, migration may need to be higher if new housing construction remains strong, which would add further to supply. As a result, sustained migration in the range of 300,000 to 350,000 per year may be needed to maintain housing demand, especially in major cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane where most new housing development is concentrated. Looking ahead, the Australian government has projected a further decline in net overseas migration. Budget forecasts estimate a reduction to approximately 260,000 migrants in the 202425 financial year. This anticipated decrease aligns with efforts to balance population growth with infrastructure and housing capacity. However, actual migration figures have at times exceeded projections so who the fuck knows.",0,0.4,28,housing,Australian Housing Dynamics and Policy Developments,Negative,2,6/12/2025 16:23,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1l9fck0/as_boomers_pass_away_a_larger_volume_of_housing/,AusProperty

She recommended determination  requesting funds, and then searching for a place 12 months time... and an additional 12 months automatically given, so 24 months to find a home. I should have done that in the first place but I was worried I wouldnt find a place and didnt want to start the timer! Anyways, relieved... thankful....and appreciate the flexibilitycompassion of the ATO in this specific situation.  1. Requested a determination on mygov several times in the past few months. 2. Bought a property at auction this past Saturday. 3. Signed the contract. Settlement of the property is 7 July 30 days from auction date. 4. Today 10 June I stupidly made another determination greedy me wanted the most gains from my super. 5. Requested to release the funds. 6. Freak out and realise I might need to have used a determination that was dated before I signed the contract. 7. On the phone trying to connect to the ATO to forgive my stupidity and greed. 8. Researching and trying to find others in this situation -- not sure about whether Im screwed or the ATO has vagueconfusing wording. 9. Found a page by Colonial which clarifies the changes made in 2024 - Key changes include  More access if youve already entered into a contract to buy your first home, but are not yet the legal owner, youll now be able to request an FHSS determination. Previously you had to request a determination before signing the contract..  More time if youve already applied for an FHSS determination and entered into a contract to purchase or build your first home, youll have up to 90 days to request the release of your funds under the FHSS scheme. Previously this period was limited to 14 days. Further, you will have up to 90 days instead of 28 days to notify the ATO that you have entered into the purchase contract.  More flexibility users of the scheme will now be able to amend or revoke requests for FHSS determinations and releases. PLEASE SOMEONE... tell me Im not screwed. The ATO says You can make a release request  before you sign a property contract, or.  within a limited period of time after signing a contract.  if your FHSS determination was made on or after 15 September 2024, you should make a release request within 90 days of signing the contract.",1,1,7,housing,Real estate financing and renovation discussions,Very Negative,1,6/10/2025 19:10,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1l7u2tu/freaking_outconfused_over_fhss_process/,AusProperty

"House prices NIMBYism, construction costs, red tape are why you cant afford to buy a home
The enabling of new planned cities and exurbs with greater density and outstanding amenities may be the best of the worst alternatives. My first appearance in the Coalition party room as planning minister began as a pleasant surprise. I was rushed by colleagues who had treated me as family and community services minister with distant, pitying looks. That day, every backbencher smiled. There are many reasons why housing has become unaffordable, but the number of councils does not help. Peter Rae As it turned out, apart from the member for Parramatta, who always wanted more infrastructure, most members wanted me to stop something. A high-rise apartment block near a railway station  no, thank you, parking problems. An old tennis court converted to apartments  no, thank you, we love tennis. A tunnel bypass with chimney stacks to get trucks off Pennant Hills Road  no way, chimney stacks cause cancer. They never stopped, members dutifully representing their communities, aided and abetted by radio shock jocks who saw opposition to development as ranting-ratings opportunities. Urban planning, and land use more generally, are the Australian states constitutional responsibility. Local councils have gradually ceded authority to state planning rules while retaining sufficient power to attract angry public meetings and the ever-present opportunities for corruption. Inner suburban councils flatly refuse to meet their housing targets. Australian governance is hallmarked by overreach  one bad media story and sweeping legislative reforms are rushed through the parliament, and planning law sets the pace. Every new government finds new ways of stopping housing, disguising this as new environmental, health or other community regulations paid for by those greedy developers and eventually by home buyers.  The number of councils aids this reluctance. Take the long-discussed Parramatta Road redevelopment in Sydney. In 2014, 13 councils needed to agree on how to reactivate and densify this mere 23 kilometres linking the villages of Sydney to Australias fastest-growing city. Unsurprisingly, they are still only talking about it 11 years later. Had I my time over again, knowing these were ALP or Green seats we could not hope to win, I would have ignored participatory democracy and overruled them. Note to our premiers if you do not need the seat, do what you like. The people of Unley Park, the northern beaches or Toorak are never going to vote for you anyway. The point is that there are few tools for a federal government to increase the supply of housing or lower its costs. Even interest rates are an uncertain path to lower costs. Reducing housing loan deposit requirements will increase demand but not supply. Offering the states and territories more money to get out of the way has not worked  regulatory costs are still estimated to constitute 50 per cent of total building expenses. National schemes inevitably fail. Gough Whitlam established the Department of Urban and Regional Development, DURD, in 1972. It invested heavily in revitalising the inner-city slums for low-income workers, immediately exploited by their richer, smarter cousins, but did nothing for density. DURD also costs a fortune. Every project it touched doubled in price as the much shrewder state housing authorities saw them coming. The ministers recent pledge to cut red tape will fall on the deaf ears of the states so long as they bear the political pain of densification. Using Commonwealth powers to reduce immigration, as former NSW premier Bob Carr urged in a rare moment of courage, would make a difference to housing demand and lessen the unrelenting need for more roads. Neatly avoided by the minister, Andrew Bragg and Andrew Leigh. Besides, reducing immigration does not affect the current crisis, merely future ones. Now that working from home is embedded, regional centres are a cheaper option for young families, but improved regional public transport is urgently required. Australias housing problem comes down to construction costs and opposition to density. This opposition, the much-discussed NIMBYism, limits potential supply and encourages over-regulation. It is based on the realistic appreciation that density does not bring better local infrastructure and transport automatically, and, when it does, is preceded by years of severe disruption. The further away the planning approval authority politically, the easier it is for elected officials to bear the pain. Bigger councils and regional authorities all help. This is precisely what modern democracies do not want a diminution of an individuals authority to protect their own interests with the national interest now a distant echo of its former self. Woe betides the first government to legislate this authority away. In fact, opposition to development would reduce if governments committed to underwriting improved construction times, expanded public transport and reduced disruption with industrial, environmental and productivity policies. The extraordinary growth in created cities and high-density vertical suburbs in the US since the war has been one response to the housing and democracy conflict. Australias current housing crisis is a profound challenge to the stability and harmony provided by high levels of homeownership. It is not as simple as spending more money. It requires attention to the more difficult problem of spending less. If it is too late to change well-entrenched inner-city communities  and it is not  then our timid governments could make boldness their friend. The enabling of new planned cities and exurbs with greater density and outstanding amenities may be the best of the worst alternatives. This crisis will not end well otherwise.",1,0.51,72,housing,Australian Housing Dynamics and Policy Developments,Negative,2,6/10/2025 11:09,https://reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1l7m07a/house_prices_nimbyism_construction_costs_red_tape/,AustralianPolitics

"15000 Owner Coorporate Fee for a small 2 bedroom unit in Melbourne Suburb? HELP 
Please help. Need help with body coorporate management, regarding maintenance fund and special resolution. We own one of the three small units of a little lot in victoria. Usual annual administration fee is 5700 for all three units. Last year, an additional 2500 was charged for maintenance fund. This year, we had our AGM meeting. The proposed administration fee is 5900 and 0 for maintenance fund. However, during the meeting, one of the owners proposed an jaw-dropping 36,000 increase to the maintenance fund to replace garage doors, painting and rendering exteriors of the units, clean and fix gutters, and so on for this year. Honestly it just didnt sound reasonable. I feel like most works involved are upgrades rather than maintenance or repair, especially these are not originally scheduled and most likely not urgent. They passed budget based on over 50 approval on the same meeting it was proposed. So we now challenged the decision based on is budget increase has not been adviced to us 14 days prior to the voting. And they agreed to hold another meeting to discuss, but insisted they only need 50 of the vote. However, we checked the laws, and feel like all these things should fall under special resolution and would request more than 75 of the vote especially the amount obviously exceeded more twice of the administration fees.

"Multiple properties on a mixed farming lot if theyre not fixed to the ground?
Id love some advice of people who are pretty excluding about building possibly flouting the rules a bits when it comes to multiple properties on more rural mixed farming Lloyd. We would love a simple but lovely main home with quite a few built buildings on the land built up overtime, not physically connected to the home, for foster kids, guests, spaces for artists on residences and healing. The property is 25 acres mostly trees but classified as mixed farming. Ideally wed want to try to be a bit cheeky with zoning by having salvaged and renovated camper vans, repurposed site offices buildings, and converted sheds and shipping containers. And there being regular outdoors drip toilets and not all of the mini buildings having running water, instead there being shower blocks like on a camping sit. Is this stuff in the above paragraph the kind of things that can actually get around more restrictive zoning for additional buildings on a property? Does anyone have any other suggestions? Were not fancy but do love giving life to old things like caravans and furniture. Really want to have as much of our family like brothers and sisters and their kids living on a big property with us well still having their own privacy and being in power to build and or fix up the places they end up living. The ultimate goal is to have one main big family home, where we can gather together regularly but the property is big enough that people can also have their own spaces. With options for long-term living and little huts for those that want to stay short term. And as an artist I would love there to be little huts for artists that need time to dedicate to their art and not have to pay rent.

"Help with comparing Project Home Builder quotes
Hey everyone, Ive been gathering quotes to do a knockdown rebuild with a project home builder  because 2.5 bedrooms just isnt cutting it for my family of seven. Ive worked in construction and Real estate for over 20 years, and even with that background, Ive been shocked by how difficult it is to compare quotes and get clear, upfront pricing from builders. In my former role as a client-side project manager, I conducted tender comparisons for projects ranging from  500,000 to over 10 million. So when I see how murky and inconsistent the pricing and inclusions are in the project home world  especially for everyday families  its honestly frustrating. Between the vague estimates, surprise costs, and mixed reviews online, its a tough environment for anyone to make one of the biggest purchases of their life. After helping a friend navigate this process recently, it became clear that some companies rely on clients not knowing the right questions to ask. Unfortunately, I had to put my own rebuild on pause due to budget constraints, but I cant stop thinking that there must be lots of people in the same boat.. So Ive been tinkering with some online tools to see if its possible to make tender comparisons easier and more transparent  something that could help people get a clearer picture of the total costs before signing a contract. Here is my Ask If youre currently in the middle of the process, or have old tendersquotes sitting around, Id love it if youd consider sharing them anonymised is fine.

"Can my brothers and I use our superannuation to purchase an investment property for my mum to live in?
Hello AusProperty, Id like to give you some context about my family and our financial situation. This is to help everyone understand that this plan is not to maximise investment returns, but its about supporting my mum. I come from a family of 4 sons technically two are half brothers, but weve never seen it this way and a single mother. Growing up we were not well off, mum wanted to own her own organic seedling business that almost always broke even, and it was difficult to keep up with mortgage repayments mum probably refinanced 3-5 times since owning the house in the 80s, but we got by with what we had. Fortunately, my brothers and I have grown up and obtained high-paying jobs, our rough income can be found below, but my mum now aged 65 is no better off. Unfortunately, due to an inheritance issue, Mums siblings forced her to sell her home in 2017, before house prices rose, any profit that was made went to the siblings, as Nan owned part of the house way back when. Mum now rents but struggles to keep up, though she now has a job and has let go of the business. My brothers and I try to support Mum, but we struggle due to the current cost-of-living crisis. My main concern for the past few years has been to ensure my mum has adequate shelter now that she has lost her property. My brothers and I have tried to figure out how I can organise some sort of property for Mum to live in, and I believe I have come up with an idea using our superannuation, but I am not experienced enough to know whether it is possible. As such, Im reaching out to Ausfinance for general advice. If it is possible, I will talk with my brothers, then I will talk to a professional accountant to start the process. First, our finances I 27M 125k before tax with a superannuation of 26K - my income is likely to rise over the next few years. I own a house with no dependents. Brother 1 26M 100k before tax with a superannuation of 30K - his income is likely to rise over the next few years. Owns a house, no dependents. Brother 2 35M 150k before tax with a superannuation of 170K - Income will likely not change. Owns a house with two dependents. Brother 3 36M 160K before tax with a superannuation of 170K - Income will likely not change. Rent, has one dependent. Mum 65W 45K before tax with no superannuation multiple early releases due to financial hardships. No dependents. I was thinking of setting up a SMSF with my brother as trustees, but not my mum, and managed by a financial professional. We would contribute 30K from our existing superannuation balance 120K and use say 200pw super contributions 800pw as regular payments to purchase an investment property likely build a house. With this investment property, we would then rent it out to our mother, who will pay rent as any non-family tenant would in order to ensure the property qualifies as an investment property and satisfy the requirements of a SMSF. The rent mum pays would contribute to the mortgage repayments. The idea would be that we can use our superannuation to effectively purchase a house for our mum, without affecting any of our personal income, tax or using any of our property as collateral. This ensures my younger brother and I can start a family, and my older brothers can continue to support their families. I fully comprehend that this will effect our retirement fund which is important, however, an investment property would still secure our superannuation. Sure, it could have less return than simply leaving it in an industry fund, but I am more worried about supporting my mother than about maximising our returns, especially as we are still young and have decades to rebuild our superannuation. I am sure there are plenty of wrinkles to iron out, but I want to know if the basic premise stands. Can my family use our superannuation to purchase an investment property, then allow my mother, who will NOT be a trustee in our SMSF, to live and pay adequate rent in this investment property? I understand there are risks and fees, and we will not maximise investment returns for our superannuation. I am sure some advice would be to use our actual money instead of our superannuation, however, I am not sure if my brothers with dependents can afford to and we all dont have much equity in our property yet and my mum has very much stressed that she does not want her life decisions and misfortunate to negatively affect our day to day lives, which superannuation will not affect our day to day lives but it will affect our retirement. I understand all advice is general advice and I will seek professional advice once we get the ball rolling. I just want to ensure this is something that is even possible, and there isnt a rule like family members cant live in investment properties.

I want to hear from people who have done a similar thing, the extended travel times, have you regretted it? I guess some concerns I have is my commute is already 40 minutes so this will bring it up over an hour each way. I also have a small side business tinting on weekends so that may impact how frequently I have customers come through. I also just wonder being 27, this house is ideally where we would end up in the future, and financially does this make sense for us to do right now, would we be better off in Melbourne, buying a house and watching it grow higher than whats out here due to demand? Aside from that we absolute love the location and the house itself and want to move on it asap!",4,0.84,4,housing,Housing Decisions and Financial Considerations for Home Buyers.,Positive,4,6/7/2025 21:09,https://reddit.com/r/AusProperty/comments/1l5ibxu/moving_from_the_city_to_the_a_smaller_town_needs/,AusProperty

"Should I invest into a rental property?
Hey all! Im completing about how I should spend me deposit. About 2 years ago now, I received a 40k inheritance from a relative who passed away. At the beginning of last year, I met my now partner and have moved 8 hours away to be with him and also for other personal reasons. My partner also has 45k deposit as well which would be potentially enough for us to buy a unit together. However, because weve only been together for 18 months and have lived together for 8 months, I dont want to put all of my eggs into 1 basket if that makes sense. On the other hand, I dont want to wait a long time to buy a home with the ever increasing prices. My thinking is that I use 20k as a deposit to purchase a rental property and use the other 20k for when my partner and I want to buy our own home in the future. Then when we decide to buy our own home eg when we are together for longer and have more stability hopefully I would either sell the rental property or use it as equity to buy our own home.

Ill laymans terms it. The VDO  Victorian Default Offer  the max price a retailer can charge you. This is reviewed annually and goes into effect every 1 July. Basically, your current prices are a reflection of the previous years electricity market conditions. As you can see from the graph, end retailer margins are actually going down and the bulk of the additional increase is due to transmission line costs. The amount of increase or decrease depends on area and whose line infrastructure you use. There are 5 lines companies in Victoria AusNet CitiPower Jemena Powercor United Energy All charge different rates depending on a varying of factors, mainly geographical. They must justify their pricing to the Victorian Government. The link to the full report which goes into detail the determination will be in the comments. Basically it isnt OMG PROFITEERING - it really isnt. The determination made it literally go down last year but see negative bias like how you never notice when petrol prices go down.

"My take on take Cadbury chocolate, one of them is still good, although still not worth the price
I stopped buying Cadbury chocolate about ten years ago. Before that, I was a massive fan. My favourite being their plain dairy milk. At the time I was living with my parents and my budget was pretty easy going, so I didnt pay attention to prices back then. Prices probably went up, and I didnt notice because I bought what ever the hell I wanted and noticed no difference. What I did notice over time however was that the chocolate did not taste the same. Ive participated in enough chocolate threads here to know that Im not the first to notice this. It was not about budget, I inevitably decided that Cadbury no longer produced chocolate that tasted good enough that I was willing to spend my money on, even though I had plenty to waste. I love chocolate and explored other avenues, but it wasnt until Whittakers chocolate became common place in the supermarkets that I found a reasonable substitute. I really do love about three of Whittakers range, I want to emphasise that I dont just like them, I love them. Theyre better than what Cadbury ever offered that was remotely similar but the rest I cant stand, usually being way too rich, or just not a flavour I like. I am one of the first people to talk shit about Cadbury chocolate, because I used to love it so much, and am resentful that they took that away. I will rarely touch Cadbury chocolate these days, not out of any principle, but purely because I know it will taste like shit for the most part. Ive had several of their blocks, several times. These blocks I used to enjoy. My favourites in order used to be, Dairy Milk, Top Deck, Fruit and Nut, Snack. I wont touch them now... Except one. Fruit and Nut is something else. Its not as good as it used to be, but its still not far off in my opinion. Perhaps the fruit and nut alter the flavour of the chocolate just enough to compensate for the detriment of quality, I dont know, but to this day, nothing still hits that spot, including Whittakers almond chocolate block, which has similar ingredients. Anyway, I just wanted to vent a little about chocolate. I know its a little lengthy for basically nothing, but I felt the need to express this because I have joined in on the hate on Cadbury every time I see it, but I do think this one product still tastes good and is beyond any of their competition.",155,0.85,142,cost_of_living,Canberra living and grocery shopping experiences.,Negative,2,6/26/2025 2:53,https://reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1lkazac/my_take_on_take_cadbury_chocolate_one_of_them_is/,australia

"Thank you Labor for paying my electricity bills
Price signals are not simply about conveying value or leverage. They contain a wealth of valuable information. Sometimes the information price signals convey is, The electricity grid is under significant strain, so maybe you should remember to turn the lights off when you arent in the room. Government subsidies are a form of market disruption that falsify the information being transmitted through price signals. When the government subsidizes electricity, it conveys to people that there has either been a decrease in demand or an increase in supply. They make decisions based on that information, such as whether or not to turn the lights off when they leave the room. It is well documented and entirely intuitive from an economic standpoint that electricity demand increases when it is subsidized by the government. This causes real strain on the grid. One of the reasons everybodys electricity bills have been going up due to the governments policy of subsidizing electricity. Personally, I left my air conditioner running for nine months straight this summer, even if the only person home was my cat. Would I have done this if the government was not paying my energy bills? Probably not. Do I feel bad about this? Also no. Thank you based Labor government for the free electricity.

"Bye bye Telstra sorta
As some of you may know, Telstra is increasing the price of their mobile plans - 70month for a basic plan is ridiculous. Yesterday I made the switch to Boost Mobile which also uses the Telstra network. 12 months prepaid for 255 which includes 290GB enough for my usage as I WFH. The reason for this post is to let people know that the signup and number porting process was surprisingly quick and smooth. Boost allowed me to sign up using my existing Telstra login. Porting my number from Telstra to Boost was handled in the app  I did need to make a call, but the number was already pre-filled, which made things easier. They even cancelled my Telstra contract on the spot. All up, the whole process took just 1015 minutes, and Im now saving 585 over the next year. Highly recommend if youre looking for a simpler, cheaper alternative while still staying on the Telstra network not a paid promotion by either Telstra or Boost. I would leave Telstra all together but their mobile coverage is better than Optus and Vodafone in my experience. Edit Ive been a Telstra customer post paid for close to 15 years.

Significantly higher reading on the invoice than what wouldve been on the meter. In fact, its almost a number pulled outta nowhere! I dont know how I misread it. I only found out today. I gotta say, I am so relieved. The Actual Meter reading invoiced in March was a higher number than the reading I did today.

"Why do rising oil prices halt interest rate cuts?
Ok hoping someone can explain this for me. Seemed to me that the Ukraine war showed us that if local inflation is being caused by foreign price increases eg. Oil going up dramatically then rising domestic interest rates is pointless, it actually harms the economy. In my view if anything increased globalforeign prices should trigger a rate cut. Money is being taken out of our economy due to increased global commodity prices, so cutting rates would help offset the impact locally and help add cash in our economy that has been taken out by rising oil prices. From the other side, to me it makes no sense to increase rates. The general idea of increasing rates due to inflation is because the underlying reason for inflation is that there is too much money in the market and the increased demand and spending power is pushing prices up. In that case increasing interest rates make sense. But when the trigger for inflation is foreign, increasing rates just exacerbates the problem and hurts our economy even further than the inflation has already. Increased fuel costs reduces spending across all other areas of the economy, but prices dont go down because underlying costs have gone up in all those areas oil is used everywhere!. So increasing rates just makes things worse. Surely when inflation triggers are foreign rates should go down not up?

Agricultural input costs continue to remain elevated ... While natural gas prices have fallen over recent months, prices are expected to remain somewhat elevated in 202526 as global supplies remain tight and natural gas demand continues to grow particularly as a bunkering fuel source Figure 3.13. Global trends of oiltogas switching are expected to continue around the world with the Middle East and Asia driving growth in demand for natural gas. A key component of this increased natural gas demand is likely to come from China which has rapidly transitioned its heavyduty road transport away from diesel and towards LNG powered trucks.
